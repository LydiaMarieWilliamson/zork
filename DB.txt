#00118:Useful commands:
      :
      :   The 'BRIEF' command suppresses printing of long room descriptions
      :for rooms which have been visited.  The 'SUPERBRIEF' command suppresses
      :printing of long room descriptions for all rooms.  The 'VERBOSE'
      :command restores long descriptions.
      :   The 'INFO' command prints information which might give some idea
      :of what the game is about.
      :   The 'QUIT' command prints your score and asks whether you wish
      :to continue playing.
      :   The 'SAVE' command saves the state of the game for later continuation.
      :   The 'RESTORE' command restores a saved game.
      :   The 'INVENTORY' command lists the objects in your possession.
      :   The 'LOOK' command prints a description of your surroundings.
      :   The 'SCORE' command prints your current score and ranking.
      :   The 'TIME' command tells you how long you have been playing.
      :   The 'DIAGNOSE' command reports on your injuries, if any.
      :
      :Command abbreviations:
      :
      :   The 'INVENTORY' command may be abbreviated 'I'.
      :   The 'LOOK' command may be abbreviated 'L'.
      :   The 'QUIT' command may be abbreviated 'Q'.
      :
      :Containment:
      :
      :   Some objects can contain other objects.  Many such containers can
      :be opened and closed.  The rest are always open.   They may or may
      :not be transparent.  For you to access (e.g., take) an object
      :which is in a container, the container must be open.  For you
      :to see such an object, the container must be either open or
      :transparent.  Containers have a capacity, and objects have sizes;
      :the number of objects which will fit therefore depends on their
      :sizes.  You may put any object you have access to (it need not be
      :in your hands) into any other object.  At some point, the program
      :will attempt to pick it up if you don't already have it, which
      :process may fail if you're carrying too much.  Although containers
      :can contain other containers, the program doesn't access more than
      :one level down.
      :
      :Fighting:
      :
      :   Occupants of the dungeon will, as a rule, fight back when
      :attacked.  In some cases, they may attack even if unprovoked.
      :Useful verbs here are 'ATTACK <villain> WITH <weapon>', 'KILL',
      :etc.  Knife-throwing may or may not be useful.  You have a
      :fighting strength which varies with time.  Being in a fight,
      :getting killed, and being injured all lower this strength.
      :Strength is regained with time.  Thus, it is not a good idea to
      :fight someone immediately after being killed.  Other details
      :should become apparent after a few melees or deaths.
      :
      :Command parser:
      :
      :   A command is one line of text terminated by a carriage return.
      :For reasons of simplicity, all words are distinguished by their
      :first six letters.  All others are ignored.  For example, typing
      :'DISASSEMBLE THE ENCYCLOPEDIA' is not only meaningless, it also
      :creates excess effort for your fingers.  Note that this truncation
      :may produce ambiguities in the intepretation of longer words.
      :
      :   You are dealing with a fairly stupid parser, which understands
      :the following types of things--
      :
      :   Actions:
      :	Among the more obvious of these, such as TAKE, PUT, DROP, etc.
      :	Fairly general forms of these may be used, such as PICK UP,
      :	PUT DOWN, etc.
      :
      :   Directions:
      :	NORTH, SOUTH, UP, DOWN, etc. and their various abbreviations.
      :	Other more obscure directions (LAND, CROSS) are appropriate in
      :	only certain situations.
      :
      :   Objects:
      :	Most objects have names and can be referenced by them.
      :
      :   Adjectives:
      :	Some adjectives are understood and required when there are
      :	two objects which can be referenced with the same 'name' (e.g.,
      :	DOORs, BUTTONs).
      :
      :   Prepositions:
      :	It may be necessary in some cases to include prepositions, but
      :	the parser attempts to handle cases which aren't ambiguous
      :	without.  Thus 'GIVE CAR TO DEMON' will work, as will 'GIVE DEMON
      :	CAR'.  'GIVE CAR DEMON' probably won't do anything interesting.
      :	When a preposition is used, it should be appropriate;  'GIVE CAR
      :	WITH DEMON' won't parse.
      :
      :   Sentences:
      :	The parser understands a reasonable number of syntactic constructions.
      :	In particular, multiple commands (separated by commas)
      :	can be placed on the same line.
      :
      :   Ambiguity:
      :	The parser tries to be clever about what to do in the case of
      :	actions which require objects that are not explicitly specified.
      :	If there is only one possible object, the parser will assume
      :	that it should be used.  Otherwise, the parser will ask.
      :	Most questions asked by the parser can be answered.
#00660:Welcome to Dungeon!
      :
      :   You are near a large dungeon, which is reputed to contain vast
      :quantities of treasure.   Naturally, you wish to acquire some of it.
      :In order to do so, you must of course remove it from the dungeon.  To
      :receive full credit for it, you must deposit it safely in the trophy
      :case in the living room of the house.
      :
      :   In addition to valuables, the dungeon contains various objects
      :which may or may not be useful in your attempt to get rich.  You may
      :need sources of light, since dungeons are often dark, and weapons,
      :since dungeons often have unfriendly things wandering about.  Reading
      :material is scattered around the dungeon as well;  some of it
      :is rumored to be useful.
      :
      :   To determine how successful you have been, a score is kept.
      :When you find a valuable object and pick it up, you receive a
      :certain number of points, which depends on the difficulty of finding
      :the object.  You receive extra points for transporting the treasure
      :safely to the living room and placing it in the trophy case.  In
      :addition, some particularly interesting rooms have a value associated
      :with visiting them.  The only penalty is for getting yourself killed,
      :which you may do only twice.
      :
      :   Of special note is a thief (always carrying a large bag) who
      :likes to wander around in the dungeon (he has never been seen by the
      :light of day).  He likes to take things.  Since he steals for pleasure
      :rather than profit and is somewhat sadistic, he only takes things which
      :you have seen.  Although he prefers valuables, sometimes in his haste
      :he may take something which is worthless.  From time to time, he examines
      :his take and discards objects which he doesn't like.  He may occasionally
      :stop in a room you are visiting, but more often he just wanders
      :through and rips you off (he is a skilled pickpocket).
#00886:Please answer the question.
#00890:You clearly are a suicidal maniac.  We don't allow psychotics in the
      :dungeon, since they may harm other adventurers.  Your remains will be
      :installed in the land of the living dead, where your fellow adventurers
      :may gloat over them.
#00919:What?  You don't trust me?  Why, only last week I patched a running
      :RSX system and it survived for over thirty seconds.  Oh, well.
#00936:Now let me see...
      :Well, we weren't quite able to restore your state.  You can't have
      :everything.
#00949:Do you wish me to try to patch you?
#00954:You are behind the white house.  In one corner of the house
      :there is a window which is #.
#00966:open
#00967:slightly ajar
#00969:You are in the kitchen of the white house.  A table seems to have
      :been used recently for the preparation of food.  A passage leads to
      :the west, and a dark staircase can be seen leading upward.  To the
      :east is a small window which is #.
#00999:You are in the living room.  There is a door to the east.  To the west
      :is a wooden door with strange gothic lettering, which appears to be
      :nailed shut.
#01018:You are in the living room.  There is a door to the east.  To the west
      :is a cyclops-shaped hole in an old wooden door, above which is some
      :strange gothic lettering.
#01039:In the center of the room is a large oriental rug.
#01046:In the center of the room is a closed trap door.
#01053:In the center of the room is an open trap door.
#01059:There is a rug lying next to an open trap door.
#01065:You are in a dark and damp cellar with a narrow passageway leading
      :east, and a crawlway to the south.  To the west is the bottom of a
      :steep metal ramp which is unclimbable.
#01087:The door crashes shut, and you hear someone barring it.
#01094:You are in a small room near the maze.  There are twisty
      :passages in the immediate vicinity.
#01106:Above you is a grating locked with a skull-and-crossbones lock.
#01114:Above you is an open grating with sunlight pouring in.
#01121:Above you is a grating.
#01124:You are in a clearing, with a forest surrounding you on the west
      :and south.
#01134:There is a grating securely fastened into the ground.
#01141:There is an open grating descending into darkness.
#01148:A grating appears on the ground.
#01153:You are in a long room on the south shore of a large reservoir.
#01161:You are in a long room, to the north of which was formerly a
      :reservoir.  However, with the water level lowered, there is merely
      :a wide stream running through the center of the room.
#01184:There is a western exit, a passageway south, and a steep pathway
      :climbing up along the edge of a cliff.
#01197:You are on the reservoir.  Beaches can be seen north and south.
      :Upstream a small stream enters the reservoir through a narrow
      :cleft in the rocks.  The dam can be seen downstream.
#01220:You are on what used to be a large reservoir, but which is now a
      :large mud pile.  There are 'shores' to the north and south.
#01236:You are in a large cavernous room, north of a large reservoir.
#01244:You are in a large cavernous room, to the south of which was formerly
      :a reservoir.  However, with the water level lowered, there is merely
      :a wide stream running through the center of the room.
#01269:There is a tunnel leaving the room to the north.
#01276:You are in a large room with giant icicles hanging from the walls
      :and ceiling.  There are passages to the north and east.
#01292:Part of the glacier has been melted.
#01297:There is a large passageway leading westward.
#01303:You are in a large square room with tall ceilings.  There are exits
      :on the north, east, and west sides of the room.  On the south wall is
      :an enormous mirror which fills the entire wall.
#01327:Unfortunately, you have managed to destroy it by your reckless
      :actions.
#01336:		BOOOOOOOOOM
#01338:You are in large room which seems to be air conditioned.  In one
      :corner there is a machine (?) which is shaped somewhat like a clothes
      :dryer.  On the 'panel' there is a switch which is labelled in an
      :obscure dialect of Swahili.  Fortunately, I know this dialect, and the
      :label translates to 'START'.  The switch does not appear to be manipulable
      :by any human hand (unless the fingers are about 1/16 by 1/4
      :inch).  On the front of the machine is a large lid, which is #.
#01397:closed
#01398:The cave is very windy at the moment, and your candles have blown out.
#01407:You are in a small room that has only one door, to the east.
#01415:In the corner of the room on the ceiling is a large vampire bat who
      :is obviously deranged and holding his nose.
#01429:A deranged vampire bat (a reject from WUMPUS) swoops down
      :from the ceiling and lifts you away...
#01442:You are at the periphery of a large dome, which forms the ceiling
      :of another room below.  Protecting you from a precipitous drop is a
      :wooden railing which circles the dome.
#01464:Hanging down from the railing is a rope which ends about ten feet
      :from the floor below.
#01475:I'm afraid that the leap you attempted has done you in.
#01482:You are in a large room with a prominent doorway leading to a down
      :staircase.  To the west is a narrow twisting tunnel.  Above you is a
      :large dome painted with scenes depicting elvish hacking rites.  Up
      :around the edge of the dome (20 feet up) is a wooden railing.  In the
      :center of the room there is a white marble pedestal.
#01523:A large piece of rope descends from the railing above, ending some
      :five feet above your head.
#01535:You are in a circular room with passages off in eight directions.
#01544:Your compass needle spins wildly, and you cannot get your bearings.
#01553:According to Prof. TAA of MIT Tech, the rapidly changing magnetic
      :fields in the room are so intense as to cause you to be electrocuted.
      :I really don't know, but in any event, something has killed you.
#01579:You are outside a large gateway, on which is inscribed:
      :
      :	"Abandon every hope, all ye who enter here."
      :
      :The gate is open.  Through it you can see a desolation, with a pile of
      :mangled corpses in one corner.  Thousands of voices, lamenting some
      :hideous fate, can be heard.
#01613:The way through the gate is barred by evil spirits, who jeer at your
      :attempts to pass.
#01624:There is a clap of thunder, and a voice echoes through the
      :cavern:  "Begone, chomper!"  Apparently, the voice thinks you
      :are an evil spirit and dismisses you from the land of the living.
#01648:You are not equipped for an exorcism.
#01653:There is a clap of thunder, and a voice echoes through the
      :cavern:  "Begone, fiends!"  The spirits, sensing the presense
      :of a greater power, flee through the walls.
#01674:You have entered the land of the living dead, a large desolate
      :room.  Although it is apparently uninhabited, you can hear the
      :sounds of thousands of lost souls weeping and moaning.  In
      :the east corner are stacked the remains of dozens of previous
      :adventurers who were less fortunate than yourself.  To the east
      :is an ornate passage, apparently recently constructed.
#01720:Amid the desolation, you spot what appears to be your head,
      :tastefully impaled on the end of a long pole.
#01734:You are standing on the top of flood control dam #3, which was
      :quite a tourist attraction in times far distant.  There are paths
      :to the north, south, east, and down.
#01755:The sluice gates on the dam are closed.  Behind the dam, there can
      :be seen a wide lake.  A small stream is formed by the runoff from
      :the lake.
#01773:It appears that the dam has been opened, since the water level behind
      :the dam is low and the sluice gate is open.  Water is rushing downstream
      :through the gates.
#01794:There is a control panel here.  There is a large metal bolt on the
      :panel.  Above the bolt is a small green plastic bubble.
#01810:The green bubble is glowing.
#01814:The water level is now up to your ankles.
#01820:The water level is now up to your shins.
#01826:The water level is now up to your knees.
#01832:The water level is now up to your hips.
#01837:The water level is now up to your waist.
#01843:The water level is now up to your chest.
#01849:The water level is now up to your neck.
#01854:The water level is now over your head.
#01859:The water level is now high in your lungs.
#01865:The room is full of water and cannot be entered.
#01872:I'm afraid you have done drowned yourself.
#01878:You hear a scream of anguish as you violate the robber's hideaway.
      :Using passages unknown to you, he rushes to its defense.
#01894:The thief gestures mysteriously, and the treasures in the room
      :suddenly vanish.
#01904:Something seems funny about the feel of the buoy.
#01911:Oh dear, you seem to have gone over Aragain Falls.  Not a very
      :smart thing to do, apparently.
#01923:You seem to be digging a hole here.
#01928:The hole is getting deeper, but that's about it.
#01935:You are surrounded by a wall of sand on all sides.
#01942:You can see a small statue in the sand.
#01947:The wall collapses, smothering you.
#01952:There is nothing to dig into here.
#01957:You are digging into a pile of bat guano.
#01963:You seem to be getting knee deep in guano.
#01969:You are covered with bat turds, cretin.
#01974:This is getting you nowhere.
#01978:You are at the top of Aragain Falls, an enormous waterfall with a
      :drop of about 450 feet.  The only path here is on the north end.
      :There is a man-sized barrel here which you could fit into.
#02002:A beautiful rainbow can be seen over the falls and to the east.
#02010:A solid rainbow spans the falls.
#02015:According to Prof. TAA of MIT Tech, the rapidly changing magnetic
      :fields in the room are so intense as to fry all the delicate innards
      :of the robot.  I really don't know, but in any event, smoke is coming
      :out of its ears, and it has stopped moving.
#02047:You are on a wide ledge high into the volcano.  The rim of the
      :volcano is about 200 feet above, and there is a precipitous drop
      :below to the floor.
#02066:The way to the south is blocked by rubble.
#02072:There is a small door to the south.
#02077:You are in a dusty old room which is virtually featureless, except
      :for an exit on the north side.
#02090:Imbedded in the far wall is a rusty old box.  It appears that
      :the box is somewhat damaged, since an oblong hole has been
      :chipped out of the front of it.
#02110:On the far wall is a rusty box, whose door has been blown off.
#02118:You are in a room with a low ceiling which is circular in shape.
      :There are exits to the east and southeast.
#02132:As you enter, your compass starts spinning wildly.
#02139:The ledge has collapsed and cannot be landed on.
#02146:The ledge collapses, giving you a narrow escape.
#02153:The force of the explosion has caused the ledge to collapse belatedly.
#02162:The ledge collapses, leaving you with no place to land.
#02169:The ledge collapses, probably as a result of the explosion.  A large
      :chunk of it, which is attached to the hook, drags you down to the
      :ground.  Fatally.
#02189:The way is blocked by debris from an explosion.
#02195:You may recall your recent explosion.  Well, probably as a result of
      :that, you hear an ominous rumbling, as if one of the rooms in the
      :dungeon has collapsed.
#02215:The room trembles and 50,000 pounds of rock fall on you,
      :turning you into a pancake.
#02226:The house shakes, and the ceiling of the room you're in collapses,
      :turning you into a pancake.
#02238:A volcano gnome seems to walk straight out of the wall and says,
      :"I have a very busy appointment schedule and little time to waste on
      :trespassers, but for a very small fee, I'll show you the way out."
      :You notice that the gnome is nervously glancing at his watch.
#02271:Suddenly a sinister, wraithlike figure, cloaked and hooded, appears
      :seeming to float in the air before you.  In a low, almost inaudible
      :voice he says, "I welcome you to the ranks of the chosen of Zork.  You
      :have persisted through many trials and tests and have overcome them
      :all.  One such as yourself is fit to join even the implementers!"
      :He then raises his oaken staff and, chuckling, drifts away like a
      :wisp of smoke, his laughter fading in the distance.
#02329:Problem reports and suggestions may currently be forwarded to:
      :		https://github.com/LydiaMarieWilliamson/zork-fortran
      :This is subject to future change.
#02348:Unfortunately, it is impossible to tell directions in here.
#02356:The slag turns out to be rather insubstantial and crumbles into dust
      :at your touch.  It must not have been very valuable.
#02372:The lid opens.
#02374:The lid closes.
#02376:Look around.
#02378:You think it isn't?
#02381:I think you've already done that.
#02386:The trophy case is securely fastened to the wall (perhaps to foil any
      :attempt by robbers to remove it).
#02399:The bottle hits the far wall and is decimated.
#02405:The basket is at the other end of the chain.
#02411:A brilliant maneuver destroys the bottle.
#02417:The water splashes on the walls and evaporates immediately.
#02425:The water spills to the floor and evaporates immediately.
#02433:It is not tied to anything.
#02437:There is nothing it can be tied to.
#02442:The rope is already attached.
#02446:The rope drops over the side and comes within ten feet of the floor.
#02455:I see no objects here.
#02458:Although you tied it incorrectly, the rope becomes free.
#02466:The rope drops gently to the floor below.
#02472:The rope is tied to the railing.
#02477:The lamp has smashed into the floor, and the light has gone out.
#02486:The rug is too heavy to lift, but in trying to raise it you
      :notice an irregularity beneath it.
#02498:The rug is extremely heavy and cannot be carried.
#02505:With a great effort, the rug is moved to one side of the room.
      :With the rug moved, the dusty cover of a closed trap door appears.
#02522:Having moved the carpet previously, you find it impossible
      :to move it again.
#02532:You are stopped by a cloud of poisonous gas.
#02538:Time passes... and you die from some obscure poisoning.
#02545:The gnome glances at his watch.  "Oops!  I'm late for an
      :an appointment."  He disappears, leaving you alone on the shelf.
#02561:Now you've done it.  It seems that the brick has other properties
      :than weight, namely the ability to blow you to smithereens.
#02577:There is an explosion nearby.
#02581:The wire rapidly burns into nothing.
#02586:The match has gone out.
#02589:The lamp appears to be getting dimmer.
#02594:The lamp is dying.
#02597:The candles grow short.
#02600:The candles are very short.
#02604:The leaves burn, and the neighbors start to complain.
#02611:The sight of someone carrying a pile of burning leaves so offends
      :the neighbors that they come over and put you out.
#02626:As you pick up the rusty knife, your sword gives a single pulse
      :of blinding blue light.
#02637:As the knife approaches its victim, your mind is submerged by an
      :overmastering will.  Slowly, your hand turns, until the rusty blade
      :is an inch from your neck.  The knife seems almost to sing as it
      :savagely cuts your throat.
#02666:A ghost appears in the room and is appalled by your desecration
      :of the remains of a fellow adventurer.  He casts a curse on
      :all of your valuables and orders them banished to the land of
      :the living dead.  The ghost leaves, muttering obscenities.
#02697:There is a rumble from deep within the earth, and the room shakes.
#02706:There is an ugly person staring at you.
#02711:The mirror is broken into many pieces.
#02716:Nobody but a greedy surgeon would allow you to attempt that trick.
#02725:You have broken the mirror.  I hope you have a seven years supply of
      :good luck available.
#02737:Haven't you done enough already?
#02742:The torch hits the glacier and explodes into a great ball of flame,
      :devouring the glacier.  The water from the melting glacier rushes
      :downstream, carrying the torch with it.  In place of the glacier,
      :there is a passageway leading west.
#02772:The melting glacier seems to have carried the torch away, leaving
      :you in the dark.
#02783:The glacier is unmoved by your ridiculous attempt.
#02790:Part of the glacier melts, drowning you under a torrent of water.
#02799:burned out ivory torch
#02802:There is a burned out ivory torch here.
#02807:The basket is raised to the top of the shaft.
#02813:The basket is lowered to the bottom of the shaft.
#02820:The cage is securely fastened to the iron chain.
#02827:You seem unable to affect these spirits.
#02833:How can you attack a spirit with material objects?
#02840:The book is open to page 569.
#02844:As hard as you try, the book cannot be closed.
#02850:A booming voice says, "Wrong, cretin!", and you notice that you
      :have turned into a pile of dust.
#02863:I'm afraid that you have run out of matches.
#02869:One of the matches starts to burn.
#02874:The match is out.
#02877:The tube refuses to accept anything.
#02882:The cyclops yawns and stares at the thing that woke him.
#02890:The cyclops, tired of all your games and trickery, eats you.
      :The cyclops says, "Mmm mmm!  Just like mom used to make 'em."
#02906:The cyclops says, "Mmm mmm!  I love hot peppers!  But oh, could I use
      :a drink.  Perhaps I could drink the blood of that thing."  From the
      :gleam in his eye, it could be surmised that you are 'that thing'.
#02932:The cyclops looks tired and quickly falls fast asleep (what did you
      :put in that drink, anyway?).
#02945:The cyclops is apparently not thirsty at the moment and refuses
      :your generous gesture.
#02956:The cyclops may be hungry, but there is a limit.
#02963:The cyclops is not so stupid as to eat that!
#02969:The cyclops seems somewhat agitated.
#02974:The cyclops appears to be getting more agitated.
#02981:The cyclops is moving about the room, looking for something.
#02989:The cyclops was looking for salt and pepper.  I think he is gathering
      :condiments for his upcoming snack.
#03003:The cyclops is moving toward you in an unfriendly manner.
#03011:You have two choices:  1. Leave  2. Become dinner.
#03018:Your actions don't appear to be doing much harm to the cyclops, but
      :they do not exactly lower your insurance premiums, either.
#03034:The cyclops ignores all injuries to his body with a shrug.
#03042:The cyclops is rather heavy and doesn't take kindly to being grabbed.
#03051:You cannot tie the cyclops, although he is fit to be tied.
#03059:Realizing just in time that you'd be stabbed in the back if you
      :tried to take the chalice, you return to the fray.
#03074:Congratulations!  Unlike the other vandals, who merely stole the
      :artist's masterpieces, you have destroyed one.
#03088:worthless piece of canvas
#03092:There is a worthless piece of canvas here.
#03098:With great effort, you open the window far enough to allow passage.
#03107:The window closes (more easily than it opened).
#03113:The bolt won't turn with your best effort.
#03119:The sluice gates open, and water pours through the dam.
#03126:The sluice gates close, and water starts to collect behind the dam.
#03135:You can't do that!
#03138:The grating is locked.
#03141:The grating opens to reveal trees above you.
#03147:The grating opens.
#03150:The grating is unlocked.
#03154:The door reluctantly opens to reveal a rickety staircase descending
      :into darkness.
#03165:The door swings shut and closes.
#03170:The door is locked from above.
#03174:The door cannot be opened.
#03178:You cannot burn this door.
#03182:The door is invulnerable.
#03186:You cannot damage this door.
#03190:The door is still under warranty.
#03195:The machine comes to life (figuratively) with a dazzling display
      :of colored lights and bizarre noises.  After a few moments, the
      :excitement fades.
#03214:The machine doesn't seem to want to do anything.
#03221:A force keeps you from taking the bodies.
#03227:The voice of the guardian of the dungeon booms out from the darkness,
      :"Your disrespect has cost you your life!" and places your head on a pole.
#03245:The lights within the room shut off.
#03250:The lights within the room come on.
#03255:Click.
#03256:There is a rumbling sound, and a stream of water appears to burst
      :from the east wall of the room (apparently, a leak has occurred
      :in a pipe).
#03274:The blue button appears to be jammed.
#03279:The boat must be on the ground to be inflated.
#03285:The boat inflates and appears seaworthy.
#03291:You don't have enough lung power to inflate it.
#03297:This boat will not inflate since some cretin put a hole in it.
#03305:Well done.  The boat is repaired.
#03310:There is a hissing sound and the boat deflates.
#03316:The boat deflates.
#03319:You can't deflate the boat while you're in it.
#03325:The boat must be on the ground to be deflated.
#03331:Very good.
#03333:The rainbow seems to have become somewhat run of the mill.
#03341:Suddenly, the rainbow appears to become solid and, I venture,
      :walkable (I think the giveaway was the stairs and bannister).
#03357:The structural integrity of the rainbow seems to have declined
      :precipitously, leaving you about 450 feet in the air, supported
      :by water vapor.
#03375:The ballon is fastened to the hook.
#03380:The balloon is not tied to anything.
#03385:The wire falls off the hook.
#03389:The box is imbedded in the wall.
#03394:What do you expect, BOOM?
#03398:The box has no door!
#03401:The box is rusted and will not open.
#03406:The box is not open, chomper!
#03410:The wire starts to burn.
#03414:"Thank you very much," he says.  "I don't believe I've seen a
      :# as beautiful.  Follow me."  A door appears on the west end
      :of the ledge.  Through the door, you can see a narrow chimney
      :sloping downward.  The gnome moves quickly, and he disappears
      :from sight.
#03447:"That wasn't quite what I had in mind", he says, crunching
      :the # in his rock hard hands.
#03459:The gnome appears increasingly nervous.
#03464:Although the implementers are gone, they foresaw that some cretin
      :would tamper with their remains.  Therefore, they took steps to
      :prevent this.
#03482:Unfortunately, we've run out of poles.  Therefore, in punishment for
      :your transgression, we shall deprive you of all your valuables, and
      :of your life.
#03501:Congratulations!  You've managed to break all the bottles.  Fortunately
      :for your feet, they were made of magic glass and disappear immediately.
#03519:As you reach for the sphere, an iron cage falls from the ceiling
      :to entrap you.  To make matters worse, poisonous gas starts coming
      :into the room.
#03538:As the robot reaches for sphere, an iron cage falls from the
      :ceiling.  The robot attempts to fend it off but is trapped below it.
      :Alas, the robot short circuits in his vain attempt to escape and
      :crushes the sphere beneath him as he falls to the floor.
#03570:There is a giant spark, and you are fried to a crisp.
#03577:Nothing seems to happen.
#03581:The whirring increases in intensity slightly.
#03587:The whirring decreases in intensity slightly.
#03593:A dull thump is heard in the distance.
#03598:The flask breaks into pieces.
#03602:Here noxious vapors prevent your entry.
#03607:Just before you pass out, you notice that the vapors from the
      :flask's contents are fatal.
#03619:Suddenly, the room appears to have become very large.
#03626:The only writing visible is a capital E.  The rest is too small to
      :be clearly visible.
#03637:You can't see through that!
#03641:The letters appear larger but are still too small to read.
#03649:The icing, now visible, says "EXPLODE".
#03654:The icing, now visible, says "EVAPORATE".
#03660:The icing, now visible, says "ENLARGE".
#03665:The pool of water evaporates, revealing a tin of rare spices.
#03673:The door to the room seems to be blocked by sticky orange rubble
      :from an explosion.  Probably some careless adventurer was playing
      :with blasting cakes.
#03692:You have been blasted to smithereens (whatever they are).
#03700:The room around you seems to be getting smaller.
#03707:The room seems to have become too small to hold you.  It seems
      :that the walls are not as compressable as your body, which is
      :more or less demolished.
#03726:The robot is injured (being of shoddy construction) and falls to the
      :floor in a pile of garbage, which disintegrates before your eyes.
#03743:How romantic!
#03745:If you must... Poof, you're dead!
#03750:The grue is a sinister, lurking presence in the dark places of the
      :earth.  Its favorite diet is adventurers, but its insatiable
      :appetite is tempered by its fear of light.  No grue has ever been
      :seen by the light of day, and few have survived its fearsome jaws
      :to tell the tale.
#03785:There is no grue here, but I'm sure there is at least one lurking in
      :the darkness nearby.  I wouldn't let my light go out if I were you!
#03803:The bucket rises and comes to a stop.
#03808:The bucket descends and comes to a stop.
#03814:You notice that the # has burned out, and that
      :the cloth bag is starting to deflate.
#03825:I hope you have more light than from a #.
#03831:I didn't realize that adventurers are stupid enough to light a
      :# in a room which reeks of coal gas.  Fortunately,
      :there is still justice in the world.
#03850:Oh, dear.  It appears that the smell coming from this room was coal
      :gas.  I would have thought twice about carrying a # in here.
#03867:There is now a puddle in the middle of the #.
#03873:The water leaks out of the # and evaporates immediately.
#03881:You won't melt it with a #.
#03885:The bolt can't be turned with your #.
#03890:It seems that a # won't do.
#03894:With a #?
#03896:The robot gladly takes the # and nods his headlike
      :appendage in thanks.
#03905:A #?  Surely you jest.
#03908:He who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is not fit for the
      :kingdom of winners.  In any case, 'BACK' doesn't work.
#03924:You'll have to speak up if you expect me to hear you.
#03931:I don't know how to do that.  I win in all cases.
#03938:At your service!
#03941:The Frobozz Company, Ltd., created, owns, and operates this dungeon.
#03950:Well, FOO, BAR, and BLETCH to you too!
#03955:It could very well be too late.
#03959:The dungeon is ALWAYS open (always room for one more).
#03966:Naturally!
#03968:AAAARRRRRRGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHH!
#03972:Very good.  Now you can go to the second grade.
#03978:Have you tried hopping around the dungeon, too?
#03984:Are you enjoying yourself?
#03988:Wheeeeee!
#03990:Do you expect me to applaud?
#03994:Such language in a high-class establishment like this!
#04001:You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
#04006:It's not so bad.  You could have been killed already.
#04013:Tough shit, asshole.
#04016:Oh, dear.  Such language from a supposedly winning adventurer!
#04024:That word is henceforth replaced with DUNGEON.
#04030:I think you are taking this thing for granite.
#04036:Brief descriptions.
#04039:Maximum verbosity.
#04042:No long descriptions.
#04045:You can see:  A #.
#04048:Swimming is not allowed in this dungeon.
#04054:I don't really see how.
#04057:I think that swimming is best performed in water.
#04064:Perhaps it is your head that is swimming.
#04070:Wasn't he an Indian?
#04073:I didn't think you would really try to go over the falls in a
      :barrel.  It seems that some 450 feet below, you were met by a number
      :of unfriendly rocks and boulders, causing your immediate demise.
#04098:Wasn't he a sailor?
#04101:The cyclops, hearing the name of his deadly nemesis, flees the room
      :by knocking down the wall on the north side of the room.
#04117:There is a clap of thunder and the east door opens.
#04124:Well what?
#04126:If you pray enough, your prayers may be answered.
#04133:Nothing happens.
#04136:I don't really know how to do that.
#04141:Do you wish to leave the game?
#04145:Underneath the pile of leaves is a grating.
#04151:Underneath the rug is a closed trap door.
#04157:Hello.
#04158:Good day.
#04160:Nice weather we've been having lately.
#04165:Goodbye.
#04167:Here, nothing happens.
#04170:Nothing happens here.
#04173:I think that phrase is getting a bit worn out.
#04179:You seem to be repeating yourself.
#04184:The # bows his head to you in greeting.
#04189:I think that only schizophrenics say hello to a #.
#04196:It is impossible to read in the dark.
#04201:How does one look through a #?
#04205:How can I read a #?
#04208:How, exactly, do I ring that?
#04212:Ding, dong.
#04214:I'm not sure that a # can be melted.
#04219:If you wish, but I can't understand why.
#04225:Dental hygiene is highly recommended, but I'm not sure what
      :you want to brush them with.
#04237:A nice idea, but with a #?
#04241:Well, you seem to have been brushing your teeth with some sort of
      :glue.  As a result, your mouth gets glued together with your nose,
      :and you die of respiratory failure.
#04263:Unfortunately, the troll can't hear you.
#04269:Inflating it further would probably burst it.
#04275:How can you inflate that?
#04279:Come on, now!
#04281:The # isn't sleeping.
#04284:This has no effect.
#04287:does not seem to do anything useful
#04292:is not notably useful
#04295:isn't very interesting
#04298:doesn't appear worthwhile
#04302:has no effect
#04304:doesn't do anything
#04307:Kicking a # #.
#04309:Waving a # #.
#04311:Playing in this way with a # #.
#04315:Fiddling with a # #.
#04318:Pushing the # #.
#04321:I don't think so.
#04324:This cannot be tied, so it cannot be untied!
#04330:How can you tie that to anything?
#04335:You can't tie the # to that.
#04339:You could certainly never tie the # with that!
#04345:The # struggles and you cannot tie him up.
#04351:Why would you tie up a #?
#04355:You can't turn that.
#04358:You certainly can't turn it with a #.
#04363:Digging with the # is slow and tedious.
#04368:Digging with a # is silly.
#04372:I don't think that anybody is home.
#04377:Why knock on a #?
#04380:It sounds like there is something inside the #.
#04386:The contents of the # spill out.
#04391:I can't get to that to move it.
#04395:You can't move the #.
#04398:You can't turn that on.
#04401:It is already on.
#04404:You can't turn that off.
#04408:It is already off.
#04411:The # is now on.
#04414:The # is now off.
#04417:It is now pitch black.
#04420:You must tell me how to do that to a #.
#04425:The # cannot be opened.
#04428:Opened.
#04429:Opening the # reveals:
#04432:The # cannot be closed.
#04435:It is already open.
#04438:It is already closed.
#04441:Closed.
#04442:There is a # here.
#04445:You are carrying a #.
#04448:It is in the #, which is in the room.
#04453:It is in the #, which you are carrying.
#04458:Time passes...
#04460:The # must be on the ground to be boarded.
#04466:I suppose you have a theory on boarding a #.
#04472:You are already in the #, cretin!
#04477:You are now in the #.
#04480:You aren't in that!
#04483:You realize, just in time, that disembarking here would probably
      :be fatal.
#04493:You are on your own feet again.
#04497:You can't go there without a vehicle.
#04502:You can't go there in a #.
#04506:I see nothing special about the #.
#04511:It is pitch dark.  You are likely to be eaten by a grue.
#04519:You are in the #.
#04522:The # has died.
#04524:The troll, disarmed, cowers in terror, pleading for his life in
      :the guttural tongue of the trolls.
#04537:The troll, now worried about this encounter, recovers his
      :bloody axe.
#04546:An unconscious troll is sprawled on the floor.  All passages out
      :of the room are open.
#04557:A nasty-looking troll, brandishing a bloody axe, blocks all passages
      :out of the room.
#04568:The troll stirs, quickly resuming a fighting stance.
#04575:The troll spits in your face, saying "Better luck next time".
#04583:The troll laughs at your puny gesture.
#04588:The troll, who is remarkably coordinated, catches the #
#04595:The troll, who is not overly proud, graciously accepts the gift
#04603:and not having the most discriminating tastes, gleefully eats it.
#04612:and being for the moment sated, throws it back.  Fortunately, the
      :troll has poor control, and the knife falls on the floor.  He does
      :not look pleased.
#04631:Sadly, a # can't be put in a #.
#04635:You can't take the #.
#04638:Aren't you forgetting something?
#04643:That would be a good trick.
#04647:The # is too big to jump over.
#04651:You should have looked before you leaped.
#04657:I'm afraid that leap was a bit much for your weak frame.
#04665:In the movies, your life would be passing in front of your eyes.
#04674:Geronimo...
#04676:I don't think that the # would agree with you.
#04682:I think you should get that first.
#04687:Thank you very much.  It really hit the spot.
#04693:How can I drink that?
#04696:I'd like to, but I can't get to that.
#04701:Thank you very much.  I was rather thirsty, probably from all
      :this talking.
#04711:The # catches fire.
#04714:Unfortunately, you were holding it at the time.
#04720:You don't have that.
#04723:The # catches fire and is consumed.
#04728:I don't think you can burn a #.
#04732:It doesn't seem to work.
#04736:Can you unlock a grating with a #?
#04741:Munging a # #.
#04743:Trying to kill a # #.
#04746:Trying to attack a # #.
#04749:There is nothing here to attack.
#04754:I've known strange people, but attacking a #?
#04760:with your bare hands is suicidal
#04765:with that is very self-destructive
#04770:You are in perfect health.
#04774:You have a light wound.
#04777:You have a serious wound.
#04781:You have several wounds.
#04785:You have serious wounds.
#04789:You are at death's door.
#04793:You can be killed by one more light wound.
#04799:You can be killed by a serious wound.
#04804:You can survive one serious wound.
#04809:You are strong enough to take several wounds.
#04815:You have been killed once.
#04819:You have been killed twice.
#04823:This gives you the rank of Cheater.
#04828:This gives you the rank of Wizard.
#04833:This gives you the rank of Master.
#04838:This gives you the rank of Winner.
#04843:This gives you the rank of Hacker.
#04848:This gives you the rank of Adventurer.
#04853:This gives you the rank of Junior Adventurer.
#04859:This gives you the rank of Novice Adventurer.
#04865:This gives you the rank of Amateur Adventurer.
#04871:This gives you the rank of Beginner.
#04876:Your sword is no longer glowing.
#04881:Your sword is glowing with a faint blue glow.
#04887:You sword has begun to glow very brightly.
#04893:Annoyed to be left unarmed in such an obviously dangerous
      :neighborhood, the thief slips off into the shadows.
#04907:The robber, somewhat surprised by this turn of events, nimbly
      :recovers his stilletto.
#04918:His booty remains.
#04921:As the thief dies, the power of his magic decreases, and his
      :treasures reappear:  A #.
#04932:  A #.
#04933:There is a suspicious-looking individual, holding a bag, leaning
      :against one wall.  He is armed with a vicious-looking stilletto.
#04950:There is a suspicious-looking individual lying unconscious on the
      :ground.  His bag and stilletto seem to have vanished.
#04965:The robber revives, briefly feigning continued unconsciousness, and
      :when he sees his moment, scrambles away from you.
#04980:Once you got him, what would you do with him?
#04986:You missed.  The thief makes no attempt to take the knife, although
      :it would be a fine addition to the collection in his bag.  He does
      :seem angered by your attempt.
#05007:You evidently frightened the robber, although you missed him.  He flees.
#05017:You evidently frightened the robber, although you missed him.  He flees,
      :but the contents of his bag fall on the floor.
#05032:Your proposed victim suddenly recovers consciousness.
#05039:The thief seems rather offended by your offer.  Do you think he's as
      :stupid as you are?
#05050:The thief places the # in his bag and thanks you politely.
#05058:The candles are not lit.
#05062:The flame is extinguished.
#05066:Alas, there's not much left of the candles.  Certainly not enough to
      :burn.
#05076:With what?
#05078:The candles are lit.
#05081:The candles are already lit.
#05085:You have to light them with something that's burning, you know.
#05093:You realize just in time that the candles are already lit.
#05101:The heat from the torch is so intense that the candles are vaporized.
#05110:Oh, no!  You walked into the slavering fangs of a lurking grue.
#05118:Oh, no!  A fearsome grue slithered into the room and devoured you.
#05127:You can't go that way.
#05130:The # is closed.
#05133:I can't reach that.
#05136:You aren't carrying that.
#05140:Dropped.
#05142:Thrown.
#05143:You watch as the balloon slowly lands.
#05148:The balloon has landed.
#05151:You have landed, but the balloon did not survive.
#05158:You watch as the balloon slowly descends.
#05164:The balloon descends.
#05167:You hear a boom and notice that the balloon is falling to the ground.
#05176:Your balloon has hit the rim of the volcano, ripping the cloth and
      :causing you to drop 500 feet.  Did you get your flight insurance?
#05193:You watch as the balloon slowly ascends.
#05199:The balloon ascends.
#05202:You watch as the balloon slowly floats away.  It seems to be ascending,
      :due to its light load.
#05214:The balloon leaves the ledge.
#05218:You watch as the balloon slowly lifts off.
#05224:The balloon slowly rises from the ground.
#05230:The cloth bag is draped over the side.
#05235:The balloon is inflated, and there is a # burning
      :in the receptacle.
#05244:The balloon is tied to the hook.
#05249:I'm afraid you can't control the balloon in that way.
#05256:You are tied to the ledge.
#05260:You don't really want to hold a burning #.
#05266:The receptacle is already occupied.
#05271:The # burns inside the receptacle.
#05276:The balloon inflates as it fills with hot air.
#05282:Not likely.
#05284:An interesting idea, but...
#05288:A valiant attempt.
#05291:You can't be serious.
#05294:Not a prayer.
#05296:You already have it.
#05299:Your load is too heavy.  You will have to leave something behind.
#05308:Taken.
#05309:Nice try.
#05311:I can't do that.
#05314:I can't reach inside.
#05317:How can you do that?
#05320:The # is already in the #.
#05324:It won't fit.
#05326:I can't reach the #.
#05329:The cage shakes and is hurled across the room.
#05335:"I am sorry but that action is difficult in the absense of a mouth."
#05344:"My vision is not that good without eyes."
#05350:"I am only a stupid robot and cannot perform that command."
#05358:ECHO
      :The acoustics of the room change subtly.
#05364:Almost as soon as the # breathes his last, a cloud of
      :sinister black smoke envelops him, and when the fog lifts, the
      :carcass has disappeared.
#05382:The # contains:
#05384:Your collection of treasures consists of:
#05390:You are carrying:
#05393:The # is carrying:
#05396:By some miracle of elven technology, you have managed to
      :stop the leak in the dam.
#05407:You are empty handed.
#05410:It is too dark in here to see.
#05414:#:
#05415:I could't find anything.
#05419:I couldn't find any valuables.
#05423:Someone carrying a large bag is casually leaning against one of the
      :walls here.  He does not speak, but it is clear from his aspect that
      :the bag will be taken only over his dead body.
#05446:Your opponent, determining discretion to be the better part of
      :valor, decides to terminate this little contretemps.  With a rueful
      :nod of his head, he steps backward into the gloom and disappears.
#05471:The holder of the large bag just left, looking disgusted.
      :Fortunately, he took nothing.
#05482:A 'lean and hungry' gentleman just wandered through.  Finding
      :nothing of value, he left disgruntled.
#05495:A seedy-looking individual with a large bag just wandered through
      :the room.  On the way, he quietly abstracted all valuables from the
      :room and from your possession, mumbling something about, "Do unto
      :others before...".
#05523:The other occupant (he of the large bag), finding nothing of value,
      :left disgusted.
#05534:The other occupant just left carrying his large bag.  You may not
      :have noticed that he robbed you blind first.
#05548:Off in the distance you hear someone saying, "My, I wonder what this
      :fine # is doing here?"
#05560:You are still recovering from the last blow, so your attack is
      :ineffective.
#05570:Attacking a dead # is pointless.
#05575:Well, you really did it that time.  Is suicide painless?
#05583:The # slowly regains his feet.
#05587:The unconscious # cannot defend himself:  he dies.
#05594:It appears that the last blow was too much for you.  I'm afraid
      :that you are dead.
#05605:Saved.
#05606:I can't access the save file.
#05610:Restored.
#05612:Your save file is obsolete and cannot be restored.
#05619:I don't understand that.
#05623:You cannot talk to that!
#05627:You cannot talk through another person.
#05632:Please input the entire command again.
#05637:Fortunately, you still have a #.
#05642:You are in a room with an exit on the west side, and a staircase
      :leading up.
#05652:A cyclops, who looks prepared to eat horses (much less mere
      :adventurers), blocks the staircase.  From his state of health
      :and the bloodstains on the wall, you gather that he is not very
      :friendly, though he likes people.
#05680:The cyclops is standing in the corner, eyeing you closely.  I don't
      :think he likes you very much.  He looks extremely hungry, even for
      :a cyclops.
#05699:The cyclops, having eaten the hot peppers, appears to be gasping.
      :His enflamed tongue protrudes from his man-sized mouth.
#05715:The cyclops, perhaps affected by a drug in your drink, is sleeping
      :blissfully at the foot of the stairs.
#05729:On the north of the room is a wall which used to be solid, but which
      :now has a cyclops-shaped hole in it.
#05743:The bottle is closed.
#05746:The bottle is already full.
#05750:The bottle is now full of water.
#05755:The water slips through your fingers.
#05760:Too many prepositions.
#05763:Too many objects.
#05766:I can't see one here.
#05769:Which one do you mean?
#05772:I can't reach that from inside the #.
#05777:What should I do with the #?
#05781:Huh?
#05782:You must supply a direct object.
#05787:You must supply an indirect object.
#05792:Normally, I would offer to patch you up, but I'm ashamed to say my
      :abilities are not equal to dealing with your present condition.
      :Please let me express my profoundest regrets.
#05815:The thief, being temporarily incapacitated, is unable to acknowledge
      :your greeting with his usual graciousness.
#05829:The thief is taken aback by your unexpected generosity but accepts
      :the # and stops to admire its beauty.
#05843:The # is open, but I can't tell what's beyond it.
#05850:The # is empty.
#05852:I don't know how to look inside a #.
#05857:There is nothing interesting there.
#05862:The implementers are dead;  therefore, they do not respond.
#05870:You can't wind a #.
#05873:You hear in the distance the chirping of a song bird.
#05880:A metallic voice says, "Hello, Intruder!  Your unauthorized presence
      :in the vault area of the Bank of Zork has set off all sorts of nasty
      :surprises, several of which seem to have been fatal.  This message
      :brought to you by the Frobozz Magic Alarm Company."
#05913:An epicene Gnome of Zurich, wearing a three-piece suit and carrying a
      :safety deposit box, materializes in the room.  "You seem to have
      :forgotten to deposit your valuables," he says, tapping the lid of the
      :box impatiently.  "We don't usually allow customers to use the boxes
      :here, but we can make this ONE exception, I suppose..."  He looks
      :askance at you over his wire-rimmed bifocals.
#05962:The gnome looks impatient:  "I may have another customer waiting;
      :you'll just have to fend for yourself, I'm afraid."  He disappears,
      :leaving you alone in the bare room.
#05984:Talk about eating rich foods!
#05988:Nothing like having money to burn!
#05993:"I wouldn't put THAT in a safety deposit box," remarks the gnome with
      :disdain, tossing it over his shoulder, where it disappears with an
      :understated "pop".
#06013:The gnome carefully places the # in the
      :deposit box.  "Let me show you the way out," he says, making it clear
      :that he will be pleased to see the last of you.  Then, you are momentarily
      :disoriented, and when you recover, you are back at the Bank Entrance.
#06045:The gnome says, "Well, I never!" and disappears with a snap of his
      :fingers, leaving you alone.
#06057:The gnome appears increasingly impatient.
#06063:There is an unpleasant grinding noise from inside the canary.
#06071:The canary chirps blithely, if somewhat tinnily, for a short time.
#06080:The canary chirps, slightly off key, an aria from a forgotten opera.
      :From out of the greenery flies a lovely song bird.  It perches on a
      :limb just over your head and opens its beak to sing.  As it does so,
      :a beautiful brass bauble drops from its mouth, bounces off the top
      :of your head, and lands glimmering in the grass.  As the canary winds
      :down, the song bird flies away.
#06127:The cliff is too steep for climbing.
#06132:The egg is already open.
#06136:There is no obvious way to open the egg.
#06142:I doubt you could do that without damaging it.
#06148:The egg is now open, but the clumsiness of your attempt has
      :seriously diminished its esthetic appeal.
#06161:The concept of using a # is certainly original.
#06167:Not to say that using a # isn't original either...
#06174:You rather indelicate handling of the egg has caused it some damage.
      :The egg is now open.
#06186:Climbing the walls is of no avail.
#06191:Bizarre!
#06193:The egg falls to the ground and is seriously damaged.
#06200:The # falls to the ground.
#06204:You are about ten feet above the ground nestled among some large
      :branches.  The nearest branch above you is beyond your reach.
#06220:On the ground below you can see:
#06225:I can't see any wall here.
#06229:That cannot be turned.
#06232:You would be lost without me.
#06236:You don't have the #.
#06239:The song bird is not here, but it is probably nearby.
#06246:I can't see any song bird here.
#06250:You feel somewhat disoriented as you pass through...
#06257:You hit your head against the # as you attempt this feat.
#06265:You can't go more than part way through the curtain.
#06272:That would involve quite a contortion!
#06277:You are in it, turkey!
#06280:As you try, your hand seems to go through it.
#06286:The # goes through it.
#06289:The # passes through the wall and vanishes.
#06295:The curtain dims slightly as the # passes through.
#06302:I can't do that with everything at once.
#06308:There is a wall there.
#06311:There is no way up.
#06314:There is no way down.
#06317:You are in part of the long hallway.  The east and west walls are
      :dressed stone.  In the center of the hall is a shallow stone channel.
      :In the center of the room the channel widens into a large hole around
      :which is engraved a compass rose.
#06347:Somewhat to the south, identical stone statues face each other from
      :pedestals on opposite sides of the corridor.  The statues represent
      :Guardians of Zork, a military order of ancient lineage.  They are
      :portrayed as heavily armored warriors standing at ease, hands clasped
      :around formidable bludgeons.
#06385:Somewhat to the north, identical stone statues face each other from
      :pedestals on opposite sides of the corridor.  The statues represent
      :Guardians of Zork, a military order of ancient lineage.  They are
      :portrayed as heavily armored warriors standing at ease, hands clasped
      :around formidable bludgeons.
#06423:A passage enters from the south.
#06428:The Guardians awake and, in perfect unison, destroy you with
      :their stone bludgeons.  Satisfied, they resume their posts.
#06444:To the north and south are large hallways.
#06450:To the north is a large hallway.
#06455:You are inside a rectangular box of wood whose structure is rather
      :complicated.  Four sides and the roof are filled in, and the floor
      :is open.
      :   As you face the side opposite the entrance, two short sides of
      :carved and polished wood are to your left and right.  The left panel
      :is mahogany, the right pine.  The wall you face is red on its left
      :half and black on its right.  On the entrance side, the wall is white
      :opposite the red part of the wall it faces, and yellow opposite the
      :black section.  The painted walls are at least twice the length of
      :the unpainted ones.  The ceiling is painted blue.
      :   In the floor is a stone channel about six inches wide and a foot
      :deep.  The channel is oriented in a north-south direction.  In the
      :exact center of the room the channel widens into a circular
      :depression perhaps two feet wide.  Incised in the stone around this
      :area is a compass rose.
      :   Running from one short wall to the other at about waist height
      :is a wooden bar, carefully carved and drilled.  This bar is pierced
      :in two places.  The first hole is in the center of the bar (and thus
      :in the center of the room).  The second is at the left end of the room
      :(as you face opposite the entrance).  Through each hole runs a wooden
      :pole.
      :   The pole at the left end of the bar is short, extending about a
#06618:foot above the bar, and ends in a hand grip.  The pole is resting on
      :the stone floor.
#06629:foot above the bar, and ends in a hand grip.  The pole has been
      :dropped into a hole carved in the stone floor.
#06643:foot above the bar, and ends in a hand grip.  The pole has been lifted
      :out of a hole carved in the stone floor.  There is evidently enough
      :friction to keep the pole from dropping back down.
#06667:foot above the bar, and ends in a hand grip.  The pole has been
      :dropped into the stone channel incised in the floor.
#06682:foot above the bar, and ends in a hand grip.  The pole is positioned
      :above the stone channel in the floor.
#06696:   The long pole at the center of the bar extends from the ceiling
      :through the bar to the circular area in the stone channel.  The
      :bottom end of this pole has a T-bar a bit less than two feet long
      :attached to it.  On the T-bar is carved an arrow.  The arrow and
      :T-bar are pointing #.

#06765:You are in a small room, with narrow passages exiting to the north

      :room by a # lying on the floor.
#06795:Though large and esthetically pleasing, the crypt is empty;  the
      :sarcophagi, bodies, and rich treasures to be expected in a tomb of
      :this magnificence are missing.  Inscribed on the wall is the motto of
      :the implementers, "Feel Free".  There is a door leading out of the
      :crypt to the south.  The door is #.
#06834:You are in an east-west corridor which turns north at its eastern
      :and western ends.  The walls of the corridor are marble.  An
      :additional passage leads south at the center of the corridor.
#06858:In the center of the north wall of the passage is a bronze door
      :which is #.
#06868:You are in a narrow north-south corridor.  At the south end is a door
      :and at the north end is an east-west corridor.  The door is #.
#06885:You are in a north-south hallway which ends in a large wooden door.
#06894:The wooden door has a barred panel in it at about head height.  The
      :panel is #, and the door is #.
#06907:You are in a large east-west corridor which opens out to a northern
      :parapet at its center.  You can see flames and smoke as you peer
      :towards the parapet.  The corridor turns south at its east and west
      :ends, and due south is a massive wooden door.  In the door is a small
      :window barred with iron.  The door is #.
#06946:You are standing behind a stone retaining wall which rims a large
      :parapet overlooking a fiery pit.  It is difficult to see through the
      :smoke and flame which fills the pit, but it seems to be more or less
      :bottomless.  It also extends upwards out of sight.  The pit itself
      :is of roughly dressed stone and is circular in shape.  It is about
      :two hundred feet in diameter.  The flames generate considerable heat,
      :so it is rather uncomfortable standing here.
      :   There is an object here which looks like a sundial.  On it are
      :an indicator arrow and (in the center) a large button.  On the face
      :of the dial are numbers "one" through "eight".  The indicator points
      :to the number "#".
#07031:one
#07032:two
#07033:three
#07034:four
#07035:five
#07036:six
#07037:seven
#07038:eight
#07039:You are in a featureless prison cell.  You can see only the flames
      :and smoke from the pit out of the small window in the closed door
      :in front of you.
#07058:You are in a featureless prison cell.  You can see the east-west
      :corridor outside the open wooden door in front of you.
#07073:Behind you is a bronze door which seems to be #.
#07080:You are in a featureless prison cell.  Its wooden door is securely
      :fastened, and you can see only the flames and smoke of the pit out
      :its small window.
#07099:You are in a featureless prison cell.  Its wooden door is securely
      :fastened, and you can see only the flames and smoke of the pit out
      :its small window.  On the other side of the cell is a bronze door
      :which seems to be #.
#07127:   As you gleefully examine your new-found riches, the dungeon
      :master himself materializes beside you and says, "Now that you have
      :solved all the mysteries of the dungeon, it is time for you to assume
      :your rightfully-earned place in the scheme of things.  Long have I
      :waited for one capable of releasing me from my burden!"  He taps you
      :lightly on the head with his staff and mumbles a few well-chosen spells.
      :You feel yourself changing, growing older and more stooped.  For a
      :moment there are two identical mages staring at each other among the
      :treasures, then you watch as your counterpart dissolves into a mist
      :and disappears, a sardonic grin on his face.
#07210:Suddenly, as you wait in the dark, you begin to feel somewhat
      :disoriented.  The feeling passes, but something seems different.
      :As you regain your composure, the cloaked figure appears before you
      :and says, "You are now ready to face the ultimate challenge of
      :Zork.  Should you wish to do this somewhat more quickly in the
      :future, you will be given a magic phrase which will at any time
      :transport you by magic to this point.  To select the phrase, say
      :	INCANT, <word>
      :and you will be told your own magic phrase to use by saying
      :	INCANT, <phrase>
      :Good luck, and choose wisely!"
#07282:The button pops back to its original position.
#07288:The mirror quietly swings shut.
#07292:The pine wall closes quietly.
#07296:The structure shakes slightly but doesn't move.
#07302:The short pole prevents the structure from rotating.
#07309:The movement of the structure alerts the Guardians.
#07316:The arrow on the compass rose now indicates #.
#07322:The structure rocks back and forth slightly but doesn't move.
#07330:The pine wall swings open.
#07334:The pine door opens into the field of view of the Guardians.
#07342:The structure has reached the end of the stone channel and won't
      :budge.
#07351:The structure slides # and stops over another compass rose.
#07359:The structure wobbles # and stops over another compass rose.
#07367:The structure wobbles as it moves, alerting the Guardians.
#07375:The Guardian notices a wooden structure creeping by, and his
      :suspicions are aroused.
#07386:Suddenly, the Guardians realize that someone is trying to sneak by
      :them in the structure.  They awake and, in perfect unison, hammer
      :the box and its contents (including you) to a pulp.  Satisfied, they
      :resume their posts.
#07414:A Guardian notices the open side of the structure, and his suspicions
      :are aroused.
#07425:Attacking the Guardians is about as futile as attacking a stone wall.
      :Unfortunately for you, your futile blow attracts their attention, and
      :they manage to dispatch you effortlessly.
#07448:The statues are impassive.
#07452:The dungeon master is taken momentarily by surprise.  He dodges your
      :blow and then, with a disappointed expression on his face, he raises
      :his staff and traces a complicated pattern in the air.  As it
      :completes you crumble into dust.
#07482:"I'm willing to accompany you, but not to ride in your pocket!"
#07490:The pole is now slightly above the floor.
#07496:The pole cannot be raised further.
#07501:The pole cannot be lowered further.
#07506:The pole is lowered into the channel.
#07511:The pole is lowered into the stone hole.
#07517:The pole is already resting on the floor.
#07523:The pole now rests on the stone floor.
#07528:The button becomes depressed.
#07532:The button pops back out.
#07536:The button is already depressed.
#07541:No doubt you have a bottle of moonbeams as well.
#07548:The beam is now interrupted by a # lying on the floor.
#07555:You can't break the beam with a #.
#07560:The # already breaks the beam.
#07564:I see no bronze door here.
#07568:The bronze door opens.
#07571:The bronze door closes.
#07574:On the other side of the door is a narrow passage which opens out
      :into a larger area.
#07585:The door won't budge.
#07588:The knock reverberates along the hall.  For a time it seems there
      :will be no answer.  Then you hear someone unlatching the small wooden
      :panel.  Through the bars of the great door, the wrinkled face of an
      :old man appears.  He gazes down at you and intones as follows:
      :   "I am the master of the dungeon, whose task it is to insure
      :that none but the most scholarly and masterful adventurers are
      :admitted into the secret realms of the dungeon.  To ascertain whether
      :you meet the stringent requirements laid down by the Great
      :Implementers, I will ask three questions which should be easy for
      :one of your reputed excellence to answer.  You have undoubtedly
      :discovered the answers during your travels through the dungeon.
      :Should you answer each of these questions correctly within five
      :attempts, then I am obliged to acknowledge your skill and daring and
      :admit you to these regions.
      :   "All answers should be in the form 'ANSWER, <answer>'."
#07705:The booming voice asks:
#07708:"From which room can one enter the robber's hideaway without passing
      :through the cyclops room?"
#07720:"Beside the Temple, to which room is it possible to go from the Altar?"
#07729:"What is the absolute minimum specified value of the Zorkmid
      :treasures, in Zorkmids?"
#07740:"What object is of use in determining the function of the iced cakes?"
#07749:"What can be done to the mirror that is useful?"
#07756:"The taking of which object offends the ghosts?"
#07763:"What object in the dungeon is haunted?"
#07769:"In which room is the phrase 'Hello sailor' useful?"
#07776:The door is securely fastened.
#07780:The wooden door opens.
#07783:The wooden door closes.
#07786:The dungeon master says, "I will stay."
#07791:The dungeon master says, "I will follow."
#07797:There is no reply.
#07800:"I prefer to stay where I am, thank you."
#07806:"I am not permitted to enter the prison cell."
#07812:"I cannot perform that action for you."
#07817:This gives you the rank of Dungeon Master.
#07823:This gives you the rank of Super Cheater.
#07829:This gives you the rank of Master Cheater.
#07835:This gives you the rank of Advanced Cheater.
#07841:You are in the Tomb of the Unknown Implementer.  A hollow voice
      :says, "That's not a bug, it's a feature!"
      :In the north wall of the room is the Crypt of the Implementers.  It
      :is made of the finest marble and is apparently large enough for four
      :headless corpses.  The crypt is #.  Above the entrance is the
      :cryptic inscription:
      :
      :		"Feel Free".
#07884:The door of the crypt is extremely heavy, but it opens easily.
#07892:The crypt is already open.
#07896:The crypt is already closed.
#07900:The crypt is closed.
#07903:The dial spins and comes to a stop pointing at "#".
#07910:There is no answer.
#07913:No one seems to be listening.
#07917:The dungeon master says, "Excellent."
#07922:The dungeon master says, "You are wrong.  You have four more chances."
#07931:The dungeon master says, "You are wrong.  You have three more chances."
#07940:The dungeon master says, "You are wrong.  You have two more chances."
#07949:The dungeon master says, "You are wrong.  You have one more chance."
#07958:The mirror is closed.
#07961:You must specify what to set the dial to.
#07967:The dial face contains only numbers.
#07972:The dial now points to "#".
#07976:The button depresses with a slight click and pops back.
#07983:The cell door is now closed.
#07987:You notice that the dungeon master does not follow.
#07994:The dungeon master catches up with you.
#07999:The dungeon master follows you.
#08003:There is a wooden wall blocking your way.
#08009:There is a large mirror blocking your way.
#08015:There is a large broken mirror blocking your way.
#08022:The structure blocks your way.
#08026:As you leave, the door swings shut.
#08031:You are in a narrow room whose west wall is a large mirror.
#08039:You are in a narrow room whose east wall is a large mirror.
#08047:You are in a narrow room whose west wall is a large wooden panel
      :which once contained a mirror.
#08059:You are in a narrow room whose east wall is a large wooden panel
      :which once contained a mirror.
#08071:The mirror is mounted on a panel which has been opened outward.
#08079:The panel has been opened outward.
#08084:The opposite wall is solid rock.
#08089:The dungeon master says, "You are wrong."  The dungeon master,
      :obviously disappointed in your lack of knowledge, shakes his head
      :and mumbles, "I guess they'll let anyone in the dungeon these days."
      :With that, he departs.
#08117:The dungeon master, obviously pleased, says, "You are indeed a
      :master of lore.  I am proud to be at your service."  The massive
      :wooden door swings open, and the master motions for you to enter.
#08142:Saves are not permitted during the endgame.
#08148:Restores are not permitted during the endgame.
#08154:The structure rotates clockwise.
#08159:The structure rotates counterclockwise.
#08164:I can't see a mirror here.
#08168:I don't see any way to open the mirror here.
#08174:The mirror breaks, revealing a panel behind it.
#08180:The mirror has already been broken.
#08185:The mirror is mounted on a wooden panel which moves slightly inward
      :as you push and back out as you let go.  The mirror feels rather
      :fragile.
#08203:The mirror is unyielding but seems rather fragile.
#08210:I can't see a panel here.
#08214:I don't see any way to open the panel here.
#08220:To break the panel you would have to break the mirror first.
#08228:The panel is not that easily destroyed.
#08233:The wooden panel moves slightly inward as you push and back out
      :when you let go.
#08244:The panel is unyielding.
#08248:A disheveled adventurer stares back at you.
#08254:The mirror is broken into little pieces.
#08260:Shards of a broken mirror are dangerous to play with.
#08267:The # side of the room is divided by a wooden wall into small
#08275:hallways to the #east and #west.
#08280:A large mirror fills the # side of the hallway.
#08286:A large panel fills the # side of the hallway.
#08292:The shattered pieces of a mirror cover the floor.
#08299:The corridor continues north.
#08303:The corridor continues south.
#08307:The corridor continues north and south.
#08312:Incantations are useless once you have gotten this far.
#08319:That incantation seems to have been a failure.
#08325:Sorry, only one incantation to a customer.
#08331:That spell has no obvious effect.
#08336:As the last syllable of your spell fades into silence, darkness
      :envelops you, and the earth shakes.  Then all is quiet.
#08351:The structure won't budge.
#08355:You are in a room with an exit to the north and a steel door to the east.
#08365:You are in a room with an exit to the north and a passage to the east.
#08374:The card slides easily into the slot and vanishes, and the steel
      :door slides open, revealing a passageway to the west.  A moment
      :later, a previously unseen sign flashes:
      :	"Unauthorized/Illegal Use of Pass Card -- Card Confiscated"
#08403:The item vanishes into the slot.  A moment later, a previously
      :unseen sign flashes "Garbage In, Garbage Out".  The #,
      :now atomized, spews through the slot.
#08423:I can't see any ladder here.
#08427:Come, come!
#08429:You hit your head on the ceiling and fall off the ladder.
#08437:You are in a small square room bounded to the north and west with
      :marble walls and to the east and south with sandstone walls.
#08453:It appears the thief was correct.
#08458:In the ceiling above you is a large circular opening.
#08465:The center of the floor is noticeably depressed here.
#08472:The west wall here has a large steel door at its center.  On one side
      :of the door is a small slit.

      :of the opening in a small slit.
#08498:There is a ladder here, firmly attached to the east wall.

#08514:There is only a passage in that direction.
#08520:The wall does not budge.
#08524:The wall slides forward and you follow it...
      :The architecture of this region is getting complex, so that further
      :descriptions will be diagrams of the immediate vicinity in a 3x3
      :grid.  The walls here are rock, but of two different types - sandstone
      :and marble.  The following notations will be used:
      :			..  = current position (middle of grid)
      :			MM  = marble wall
      :			SS  = sandstone wall
      :			??  = unknown (blocked by walls).
#08578:The wall slides forward and you follow it to the following position:
#08587:Your position is as follows:
#08591:The exit is too far above your head.
#08596:With the help of the ladder, you exit the puzzle.
#08603:Don't be lazy, type the command yourself.
#08609:In the MDL sources, NOOBJ is described as a "hack".  As we are
      :above such practices, NOOBJ is not implemented.

      :ends the battle and your life.
#09435:A quick thrust pinks your left arm, and blood starts to trickle
      :down.
#09444:Raking his stilletto across your arm, the thief draws blood.
#09452:The stilletto flashes faster than you can follow, and blood
      :wells from your leg.
#09463:The thief slowly approaches, strikes like a snake, and leaves you
      :wounded.
#09473:The thief strikes like a snake!  The resulting wound is serious.
#09482:The thief stabs a deep cut in your upper arm.
#09488:The stilletto touches your forehead, and the welling blood obscures
      :your vision.
#09499:The thief strikes at your wrist, and suddenly your grip is slippery
      :with blood.
#09509:The butt of his stilletto cracks you on the skull, and you stagger back.
#09519:You are forced back and trip over your own feet, falling heavily to
      :the floor.
#09529:The thief rams the haft of his blade into your stomach, leaving you
      :out of breath.
#09540:The thief attacks, and you fall back desperately.
#09547:A long theatrical slash.  You parry it desperately, but the thief
      :twists his knife, and your # goes flying.
#09561:The thief neatly flips your # out of your hands, and it drops to the
      :floor.
#09571:You parry a low thrust, and your # slips out of your hand.
#09579:Avoiding the thief's stilletto, you stumble to the floor, dropping
      :your #.
#09589:The thief, a man of good breeding, refrains from attacking a helpless
      :opponent.
#09599:The thief amuses himself by searching your pockets.
#09606:The thief entertains himself by rifling your pack.
#09613:The thief, noticing you beginning to stir, reluctantly finishes you off.
#09623:The thief, forgetting his essentially genteel upbringing, cuts your
      :throat.
#09633:The thief, who is essentially a pragmatist, dispatches you as a threat
      :to his livelihood.
#09645:You are in a narrow east-west passageway.  There is a narrow staircase
      :leading down at the north end of the room.
#09660:You are in an open field west of a big white house with a boarded
      :front door.
#09670:You are facing the north side of a white house.  There is no door here,
      :and all the windows are barred.
#09683:You are facing the south side of a white house.  There is no door here,
      :and all the windows are barred.
#09696:You are in the attic.  The only exit is stairs that lead down.
#09704:You are in a small room with passages off in all directions.
      :Bloodstains and deep scratches (perhaps made by an axe) mar the walls.
#09721:You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
#09728:Dead end.
#09730:You are in a forest, with trees in all directions around you.
#09738:You are in a dimly lit forest, with large trees all around.  To the
      :east, there appears to be sunlight.
#09751:You are in a dimly lit forest, with large trees all around.  One
      :particularly large tree with some low branches stands here.
#09767:You are in a large forest, with trees obstructing all views except
      :to the east, where a small clearing may be seen.
#09782:You are in a deep ravine at a crossing with an east-west crawlway.
      :Some stone steps are at the south of the ravine and a steep staircase
      :descends.
#09801:You are in a crawlway with a three foot high ceiling.  Your footing
      :is very unsure here due to the assortment of rocks undefoot.  Passages
      :can be seen in the east, west, and northwest corners of the crawlway.
#09828:You are standing on a path beside a gently flowing stream.  The path
      :travels to the north and the east.
#09841:You are on the gently flowing stream.  The upstream route is too narrow
      :to navigate, and the downstream route is invisible due to twisting
      :walls.  There is a narrow beach to land on.
#09864:You are in a room which looks like an Egyptian tomb.  There is an
      :ascending staircase in the room as well as doors east and south.
#09881:You are in a small chamber behind the remains of the great glacier.
      :To the south and west are small passageways.
#09896:You are in an ancient room, long buried by the reservoir.  There are
      :exits to the southeast and upward.
#09909:You are on the south edge of a deep canyon.  Passages lead off
      :to the east, south, and northwest.  You can hear the sound of
      :flowing water below.
#09928:You are in a large room with a ceiling which cannot be detected from
      :the ground.  There is a narrow passage from east to west and a stone
      :stairway leading upward.  The room is extremely noisy.  In fact, it
      :is difficult to hear yourself think.
#09959:You are in a small cave with an entrance to the north and a stairway
      :leading down.
#09970:You are in a tiny cave with entrances west and north, and a dark,
      :forbidding staircase leading down.
#09983:You are in a steep and narrow crawlway.  There are two exits nearby to
      :the south and southwest.
#09995:You are in a narrow crawlway.  The crawlway leads from north to south,
      :However, the south passage divides to the south and southwest.
#10012:You are in a cold and damp corridor where a long east-west passageway
      :intersects with a northward path.
#10025:You are in a winding passage.  It seems that there is only an exit
      :on the east end, although the whirring from the round room can be
      :heard faintly to the north.
#10046:You are in a small chamber, which appears to have been part of a
      :coal mine.  On the south wall of the chamber the letters "GRANITE
      :WALL" are etched in the rock.  To the east is a long passage, and
      :there is a steep metal slide twisting downward.  From the appearance
      :of the slide, an attempt to climb up it would be impossible.  To the
      :north is a small opening.
#10092:You are standing at the entrance of what might have been a coal
      :mine.  To the northeast and the northwest are entrances to the mine,
      :and there is another exit on the south end of the room.
#10116:You are in a small room.  Strange squeaky sounds may be hear coming
      :from the passage at the west end.  You may also escape to the south.
#10134:You are in a large room, in the middle of which is a small shaft
      :descending through the floor into darkness below.  To the west and
      :the north are exits from this room.  Constructed over the top of the
      :shaft is a metal framework to which a heavy iron chain is attached.
#10168:You are in a narrow tunnel with large wooden beams running across
      :the ceiling and around the walls.  A path from the south splits into
      :paths running west and northeast.
#10190:You are in a small non-descript room.  However, from the direction
      :of a small descending staircase a foul odor can be detected.  To the
      :east is a narrow path.
#10210:You are in a small room which smells strongly of coal gas.
#10218:You are in a very small room.  In the corner is a rickety wooden
      :ladder, leading downward.  It might be safe to descend.  There is
      :also a staircase leading upward.
#10239:You are in a non-descript part of a coal mine.
#10245:You are in a rather wide room.  On one side is the bottom of a
      :narrow wooden ladder.  To the northeast and the south are passages
      :leaving the room.
#10264:You are in a long and narrow passage, which is cluttered with broken
      :timbers.  A wide passage comes from the north and turns at the
      :southwest corner of the room into a very narrow passageway.
#10288:You are in a small square room which is at the bottom of a long
      :shaft.  To the east is a passageway and to the northeast a very narrow
      :passage.  In the shaft can be seen a heavy iron chain.
#10312:You are in a north-south crawlway;  a passage also goes to the east.
      :There is a hole above, but it provides no opportunities for climbing.
#10330:You are on the west edge of a chasm, the bottom of which cannot be
      :seen.  The east side is sheer rock, providing no exits.  A narrow
      :passage goes west.  The path you are on continues to the north and south.
#10356:You are in a high north-south passage, which forks to the northeast.
#10365:A chasm runs southwest to northeast.  You are on the south edge.  The
      :path exits to the south and to the east.
#10379:You are in a cave.  Passages exit to the south and to the east, but
      :the cave narrows to a crack to the west.  The earth is particularly
      :damp here.
#10398:A chasm, evidently produced by an ancient river, runs through the
      :cave here.  Passages lead off in all directions.
#10413:You have entered a cave with passages leading north and southeast.
#10422:This is a room which is bare on all sides.  There is an exit down.
      :To the east is a great door made of stone.  Above the door, the
      :following words are written:  "No man shall enter this room without
      :solving this riddle--
      :	What is tall as a house,
      :	Round as a cup,
      :	And all the king's horses can't draw it up?".
#10461:This is a former broom closet.  The exits are to the east and west.
#10470:You are standing in a small circular room with a pedestal.  A set of
      :stairs leads up, and passages leave the the east and west.
#10486:You are in the west end of a large temple.  On the south wall is an
      :ancient inscription, probably a prayer in a long-forgotten language.
      :The north wall is solid granite.  The entrance at the west end of the
      :room is through huge marble pillars.
#10517:You are in the east end of a large temple.  In front of you is what
      :appears to be an altar.
#10529:This room appears to have been the waiting room for groups touring
      :the dam.  There are exits here to the north and east marked
      :"PRIVATE", though the doors are open, and an exit to the south.
#10553:You are in what appears to have been the maintenance room for flood
      :control dam #3, judging by the assortment of tool chests around the
      :room.  Apparently, this room has been ransacked recently, for most of
      :the valuable equipment is gone.  On the wall in front of you is a
      :panel of buttons, which are labelled in EBCDIC.  However, they are of
      :different colors:  blue, yellow, brown, and red.  The doors to this
      :room are in the west and south ends.
#10609:You are in a long passage.  To the south is one entrance.  On the
      :east there is an old wooden door with a large hole in it (about
      :cyclops sized).
#10628:This is a large room, whose north wall is solid granite.  A number
      :of discarded bags, which crumble at your touch, are scattered about
      :on the floor.  There is an exit down and what appears to be a newly
      :created passage to the east.
#10657:You are in what appears to have been an artist's studio.  The walls
      :and floors are splattered with paints of 69 different colors.
      :Strangely enough, nothing of value is hanging here.  At the north and
      :northwest of the room are open doors (also covered with paint).  An
      :extremely dark and narrow chimney leads up from a fireplace.  Although
      :you might be able to get up the chimney, it seems unlikely that you
      :could get back down.
#10711:You are in an art gallery.  Most of the paintings which were here
      :have been stolen by vandals with exceptional taste.  The vandals
      :left through the north, south, or west exits.
#10734:You are at the base of flood control dam #3, which looms above you
      :and to the north.   The Frigid River is flowing by here.  Across the
      :river are the white cliffs, which seem to form a giant wall stretching
      :from north to south along the east shore of the river as it winds its
      :way downstream.
#10771:You are on the Frigid River in the vicinity of the dam.  The river
      :flows quietly here.  There is a landing on the west shore.
#10787:The river turns a corner here making it impossible to see the
      :dam.  The white cliffs loom on the east bank, and large rocks
      :prevent landing on the west.
#10807:The river descends here into a valley.  There is a narrow beach on
      :the east below the cliffs, and there is some shore on the west which
      :may be suitable.  In the distance a faint rumbling can be heard.
#10833:You are on a narrow strip of beach which runs along the base of the
      :white cliffs.  The only path here is a narrow one, heading south
      :along the cliffs.
#10852:You are on a rocky, narrow strip of beach beside the cliffs.  A
      :narrow path leads north along the shore.
#10866:The river is running faster here, and the sound ahead appears to be
      :that of rushing water.  On the west shore is a sandy beach.  A small
      :area of beach can also be seen below the cliffs.
#10890:The sound of rushing water is nearly unbearable here.  On the west
      :shore is a large landing area.
#10903:You are on the shore of the river.  The river here seems somewhat
      :treacherous.  A path travels from north to south here, the south end
      :quickly turning around a sharp corner.
#10925:You are on a large sandy beach at the shore of the river, which is
      :flowing quickly by.  A path runs beside the river to the south here.
#10942:You are on the west shore of the river.  An entrance to a cave is
      :to the northwest.  The shore is very rocky here.
#10957:You are in a small cave whose exits are on the south and northwest.
#10966:You are in a barrel.  Congratulations.  Etched into the side of the
      :barrel is the word "GERONIMO!".
#10979:You are on top of a rainbow (I bet you never thought you would walk
      :on a rainbow), with a magnificent view of the falls.  The rainbow
      :travels east-west here.
#10999:You are on a small beach on the continuation of the Frigid River
      :past the falls.  The beach is narrow due to the presence of the white
      :cliffs.  The river canyon opens here, and sunlight shines in from
      :above.  A rainbow crosses over the falls to the west, and a narrow path
      :continues to the southeast.
#11037:You are beneath the walls of the river canyon, which may be climbable
      :here.  There is a small stream here, which is the lesser part of the
      :runoff of Aragain Falls.  To the north is a narrow path.
#11062:You are on a ledge about halfway up the wall of the river canyon.
      :You can see from here that the main flow from Aragain Falls twists
      :along a passage which it is impossible to enter.  Below you is the
      :canyon bottom.  Above you is more cliff, which still appears
      :climbable.
#11096:You are at the top of the great canyon on its south wall. From here
      :there is a marvelous view of the canyon and parts of the Frigid River
      :upstream.  Across the canyon, the walls of the white cliffs still
      :appear to loom far above.  Following the canyon upstream (north and
      :northwest), Aragain Falls may be seen, complete with rainbow.
      :Fortunately, my vision is better than average, and I can discern the
      :top of flood control dam #3 far to the distant north.  To the
      :west and south can be seen an immense forest, stretching for miles
      :around.  It is possible to climb down into the canyon from here.
#11171:You are at the bottom of a large dormant volcano.  High above you
      :light may be seen entering from the cone of the volcano.  The only
      :exit here is to the north.
#11191:You are about one hundred feet above the bottom of the volcano.  The
      :top of the volcano is clearly visible here.
#11206:You are about two hundred feet above the volcano floor.  Looming
      :above is the rim of the volcano.  There is a small ledge on the
      :west side.
#11224:You are high above the floor of the volcano.  From here the rim of
      :the volcano looks very narrow, and you are quite near it.  To the
      :east is what appears to be a viewing ledge, too thin to land on.
#11249:You are near the rim of the volcano, which is only about fifteen feet
      :across.  To the west, there is a place to land with a wide ledge.
#11266:You are on a narrow ledge overlooking the inside of an old dormant
      :volcano.  This ledge appears to be about in the middle between the
      :floor below and the rim above.  There is an exit here to the south.
#11292:You are on a ledge in the middle of a large volcano.  Below you
      :the volcano bottom can be seen and above is the rim of the volcano.
      :A couple of ledges can be seen on the other side of the volcano;
      :it appears that this ledge is intermediate in elevation between
      :those on the other side.  The exit from this room is to the east.
#11333:You are in a room which must have been a large library, probably
      :for the royal family.  All of the shelves appear to have been gnawed
      :to pieces by unfriendly gnomes.  To the north is an exit.
#11357:You are in a small room, whose walls are formed by an old lava flow.
      :There are exits here to the west and the south.
#11372:You are in a large room full of assorted heavy machinery.  The room
      :smells of burned resistors.  The room is noisy from the whirring
      :sounds of the machines.  Along one wall of the room are three buttons
      :which are, respectively, round, triangular, and square.  Naturally,
      :above the buttons are instructions written in EBCDIC.  A large sign
      :above all the buttons says in English:
      :
      :		    DANGER:  HIGH VOLTAGE
      :
      :There are exits to the west and the south.
#11429:You are in a dingy closet adjacent to the machine room.  On one wall
      :is a small sticker which reads:
      :
      :		Protected by
      :		  FROBOZZ
      :	     Magic Alarm Company
      :	      (Hello, footpad!).
#11452:You are trapped inside an steel cage.
#11457:You are at the top of the well.  Well done.  There are etchings on
      :the side of the well.  There is a small crack across the floor at the
      :entrance to a room on the east, but it can be crossed easily.
#11482:You are in a damp circular room, whose walls are made of brick and
      :mortar.  The roof of this room is not visible, but there appear to be
      :some etchings on the walls.  There is a passageway to the west.
#11508:You are in a small square room, in the center of which is a large
      :oblong table, no doubt set for afternoon tea.  It is clear from the
      :objects on the table that the users were indeed mad.  In the eastern
      :corner of this room is a small hole no more than four inches high.
      :There are passageways leading away to the west and the northwest.
#11550:You are in an enormous room, in the center of which are four wooden
      :posts delineating a rectangular area, above which is what appears to
      :be a wooden roof.  In fact, all objects in this room appear to be
      :abnormally large.  To the east is a passageway.  There is a large
      :chasm on the west and the northwest.
#11589:You are in a large room, one half of which is depressed.  There is a
      :large leak in the ceiling through which brown colored goop is
      :falling.  The only exit from this room is to the west.
#11613:You are in the large entrance hall of the Bank of Zork, the largest
      :banking institution of the Great Underground Empire.  A partial
      :account of its history is in "The Lives of the Twelve Flatheads" with
      :the chapter on J. Pierpont Flathead.  A more detailed history (albeit
      :less objective) may be found in Flathead's outrageous autobiography
      :"I'm Rich and You Aren't - So There!".
      :Most of the furniture has been ravaged by passing scavengers.  All
      :that remains are two signs at the northwest and northeast corners of
      :the room, which say
      :
      :	<-- WEST VIEWING ROOM		EAST VIEWING ROOM -->
#11686:You are in a small square room, which was used by a bank officer
      :whose job it was to retrieve safety deposit boxes for the customer.
      :On the north side of the room is a sign which reads "Viewing Room".
      :On the west side of the room, above an open door, is a sign reading
      :
      :		    BANK PERSONNEL ONLY
#11723:You are in a small square room, which was used by a bank officer
      :whose job it was to retrieve safety deposit boxes for the customer.
      :On the north side of the room is a sign which reads "Viewing Room".
      :On the east side of the room, above an open door, is a sign reading
      :
      :		    BANK PERSONNEL ONLY
#11760:You are in a room used by holders of safety deposit boxes to view
      :their contents.  On the north side of the room is a sign which says
      :
      :   REMAIN HERE WHILE THE BANK OFFICER RETRIEVES YOUR DEPOSIT BOX
      :    WHEN YOU ARE FINISHED, LEAVE THE BOX, AND EXIT TO THE SOUTH
      :     AN ADVANCED PROTECTIVE DEVICE PREVENTS ALL CUSTOMERS FROM
      :      REMOVING ANY SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX FROM THIS VIEWING AREA!
      :               Thank you for banking at the Zork!
#11815:You are in a small bare room with no distinguishing features.  There
      :are no exits from this room.
#11828:You are in the Vault of the Bank of Zork, in which there are no doors.
#11837:You are in a large rectangular room.  The east and west walls here
      :were used for storing safety deposit boxes.  As might be expected,
      :all have been carefully removed by evil persons.  To the east, west,
      :and south of the room are large doorways.  The northern "wall"
      :of the room is a shimmering curtain of light.  In the center of the
      :room is a large stone cube, about 10 feet on a side.  Engraved on
      :the side of the cube is some lettering.
#11892:This room was the office of the Chairman of the Bank of Zork.
      :Like the other rooms here, it has been extensively vandalized.
      :The lone exit is to the north.
#11912:You are standing at the top of a flight of stairs that lead down to
      :a passage below.  Dim light, as from torches, can be seen in the
      :passage.  Behind you the stairs lead into untouched rock.
#11936:You are standing near one end of a long dimly lit hall.  To the
      :south, stone stairs ascend.  To the north, the corridor is illuminated
      :by torches set high in the wall, out of reach.  On one wall
      :is a red button.
#11963:You are in a corridor with polished marble walls.  The corridor
      :widens into larger areas as it turns east at its northern and
      :southern ends.
#11981:You are in a corridor with polished marble walls.  The corridor
      :widens into larger areas as it turns west at its northern and
      :southern ends.
#11999:You are in a room of large size, richly appointed and decorated
      :in a style that bespeaks exquisite taste.  To judge from its
      :contents, it is the ultimate storehouse of the treasures of Zork.
      :   There are chests here containing precious jewels, mountains of
      :zorkmids, rare paintings, ancient statuary, and beguiling curios.
      :   In one corner of the room is a bookcase boasting such volumes
      :as "The History of the Great Underground Empire", "The Lives of
      :the Twelve Flatheads", "The Wisdom of the Implementers", and
      :other informative and inspiring works.
      :   On one wall is a completely annotated map of the Dungeon of
      :Zork, showing points of interest and various troves of treasure,
      :and indicating the locations of several superior scenic views.
      :   On the desk at the far end of the room may be found stock
      :certificates representing a controlling interest in FrobozzCo
      :International, the multinational conglomerate and parent company
      :of the Frobozz Magic Boat Co., etc.
#12120:You are in a small square room, in the middle of which is a recently
      :created hole through which you can barely discern the floor some ten
      :feet below.  It doesn't seem likely you could climb back up.  There
      :are exits to the west and south.

#13501:Sitting on the pedestal is a flaming torch, made of ivory.
#13509:Lying half buried in the mud is an old trunk, bulging with jewels.
#13518:Lying in the corner of the room is a small brass bell.

#13532:On the two ends of the altar are burning candles.
#13539:A guidebook entitled "FLOOD CONTROL DAM #3" is on the
      :reception desk.
#13548:Fortunately, there is still one chance for you to be a vandal, for on
      :the far wall is a work of unparalleled beauty.
#13563:At the end of the rainbow is a pot of gold.
#13569:A sharp stick, which appears to have been broken at one end, is here.
#13578:On the floor is a gold zorkmid coin (a valuable collector's item).
#13587:The excessively gaudy crown of Lord Dimwit Flathead is here.
#13595:There is a large pile of empty Coke bottles here, evidently produced
      :by the implementers during their long struggle to win totally.
#13612:There is a gigantic pile of line-printer output here.  Although the
      :paper once contained useful information, almost nothing can be
      :distinguished now.
#13631:On the floor sit 200 neatly stacked zorkmid bills.
#13638:A portrait of J. Pierpont Flathead hangs on the wall.
#13645:On the branch is a small birds nest.
#13650:In the bird's nest is a large egg encrusted with precious jewels,
      :apparently scavenged somewhere by a childless songbird.  The egg is
      :covered with fine gold inlay and ornamented in lapis lazuli and
      :mother-of-pearl.  Unlike most eggs, this one is hinged and has a
      :delicate looking clasp holding it closed.  The egg appears extremely
      :fragile.
#13693:There is a golden clockwork canary nestled in the egg.  It has ruby
      :eyes and a silver beak.  Through a crystal window below its left
      :wing you can see intricate machinery inside.  It appears to have
      :wound down.
#13720:There is a golden clockwork canary nestled in the egg.  It seems to
      :have recently had a bad experience.  The mountings for its jewel-like
      :eyes are empty, and its silver beak is crumpled.  Through a cracked
      :crystal window below its left wing you can see the remains of
      :intricate machinery.  It is not clear what result winding it would
      :have, as the mainspring appears sprung.
#13767:Nestled inside the niche is an engraved gold card.
#13774:The engravings were incised in the living rock of the cave wall by
      :an unknown hand.  They depict, in symbolic form, the beliefs of the
      :ancient peoples of Zork.  Skillfully interwoven with the bas reliefs
      :are excerpts illustrating the major tenets expounded by the sacred
      :texts of the religion of that time.  Unfortunately, a later age seems
      :to have considered them blasphemous and just as skillfully excised them.
#13826:The prayer is inscribed in an ancient script which is hardly
      :remembered these days, much less understood.  What little of it can
      :be made out seems to be a diatribe against small insects,
      :absent-mindedness, and the picking up and dropping of small objects.  The
      :final verse seems to consign trespassers to the land of the
      :dead.  All evidence indicates that the beliefs of the ancient
      :Zorkers were obscure indeed.
#13878:		Commandment #12592
      :Oh ye who go about saying unto each other:  "Hello sailor":
      :Dost thou know the magnitude of thy sin before the gods?
      :Yea, verily, thou shalt be ground between two stones.
      :Shall the angry gods cast thy body into the whirlpool?
      :Surely, thy eye shall be put out with a sharp stick!
      :Even unto the ends of the earth shalt thou wander and
      :unto the land of the dead shalt thou be sent at last.
      :Surely thou shalt repent of thy cunning.

      :		Flood Control Dam #3
      :
      :  Flood control dam #3 (FCD #3) was constructed in year 783 of the
      :Great Underground Empire to harness the destructive power of the
      :Frigid River.  This work was supported by a grant of 37 million
      :zorkmids from the central bureaucracy and your own omnipotent local
      :tyrant Lord Dimwit Flathead the Excessive.  This impressive structure
      :is composed of 3.7 cubic feet of concrete, is 256 feet tall at the
      :center, and 193 feet wide at the top.  The reservoir created behind
      :the dam has a volume of 37 billion cubic feet, an area of 12 million
      :square feet, and a shore line of 36 thousand feet.
      :
      :  The construction of FCD #3 took 112 days from ground breaking to
      :the dedication.  It required a work force of 384 slaves, 34 slave
      :drivers, 12 engineers, 2 turtle doves, and a partridge in a pear
      :tree.  The work was managed by a command team composed of 234
      :bureaucrats, 2347 secretaries (at least two of whom could type),
      :12,256 paper shufflers, 52,469 rubber stampers, 245,193 red tape
      :processors, and nearly one million dead trees.
      :
      :  We will now point out some of the more interesting features of
      :FCD #3 as we conduct you on a guided tour of the facilities.

      :Mr. TAA of Muddle, Mass. says:  "Before I took this course I used
      :to be a lowly bit twiddler.  Now with what I learned at MIT Tech
      :I feel really important and can obfuscate and confuse with the best."
      :
      :Mr. MARC had this to say:  "Ten short days ago all I could look
      :forward to was a dead-end job as a engineer.  Now I have a promising
      :future and make really big Zorkmids."
      :
      :MIT Tech can't promise these fantastic results to everyone, but when
      :you earn your MDL degree from MIT Tech your future will be brighter.

#14319:		    Welcome to Dungeon!
      :
      :   Dungeon is a game of adventure, danger, and low cunning.  In it
      :you will explore some of the most amazing territory ever seen by mortal
      :man.  Hardened adventurers have run screaming from the terrors contained
      :within.
      :
      :   In Dungeon, the intrepid explorer delves into the forgotten secrets
      :of a lost labyrinth deep in the bowels of the earth, searching for
      :vast treasures long hidden from prying eyes, treasures guarded by
      :fearsome monsters and diabolical traps!
      :
      :   No DECsystem should be without one!
      :
      :   Dungeon was created at the Programming Technology Division of the MIT
      :Laboratory for Computer Science by Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce
      :Daniels, and Dave Lebling.  It was inspired by the Adventure game of
      :Crowther and Woods, and the Dungeons and Dragons game of Gygax
      :and Arneson.  The original version was written in MDL (alias MUDDLE).
      :The current version was translated from MDL into FORTRAN IV by
      :a somewhat paranoid DEC engineer who prefers to remain anonymous,
      :and was later translated to C and then updated to C99.
