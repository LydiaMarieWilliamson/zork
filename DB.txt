#00064:Useful commands:
      :
      :   The 'BRIEF' command suppresses printing of long room descriptions
      :for rooms which have been visited.  The 'SUPERBRIEF' command suppresses
      :printing of long room descriptions for all rooms.  The 'VERBOSE'
      :command restores long descriptions.
      :   The 'INFO' command prints information which might give some idea
      :of what the game is about.
      :   The 'QUIT' command prints your score and asks whether you wish
      :to continue playing.
      :   The 'SAVE' command saves the state of the game for later continuation.
      :   The 'RESTORE' command restores a saved game.
      :   The 'INVENTORY' command lists the objects in your possession.
      :   The 'LOOK' command prints a description of your surroundings.
      :   The 'SCORE' command prints your current score and ranking.
      :   The 'TIME' command tells you how long you have been playing.
      :   The 'DIAGNOSE' command reports on your injuries, if any.
      :
      :Command abbreviations:
      :
      :   The 'INVENTORY' command may be abbreviated 'I'.
      :   The 'LOOK' command may be abbreviated 'L'.
      :   The 'QUIT' command may be abbreviated 'Q'.
      :
      :Containment:
      :
      :   Some objects can contain other objects.  Many such containers can
      :be opened and closed.  The rest are always open.   They may or may
      :not be transparent.  For you to access (e.g., take) an object
      :which is in a container, the container must be open.  For you
      :to see such an object, the container must be either open or
      :transparent.  Containers have a capacity, and objects have sizes;
      :the number of objects which will fit therefore depends on their
      :sizes.  You may put any object you have access to (it need not be
      :in your hands) into any other object.  At some point, the program
      :will attempt to pick it up if you don't already have it, which
      :process may fail if you're carrying too much.  Although containers
      :can contain other containers, the program doesn't access more than
      :one level down.
      :
      :Fighting:
      :
      :   Occupants of the dungeon will, as a rule, fight back when
      :attacked.  In some cases, they may attack even if unprovoked.
      :Useful verbs here are 'ATTACK <villain> WITH <weapon>', 'KILL',
      :etc.  Knife-throwing may or may not be useful.  You have a
      :fighting strength which varies with time.  Being in a fight,
      :getting killed, and being injured all lower this strength.
      :Strength is regained with time.  Thus, it is not a good idea to
      :fight someone immediately after being killed.  Other details
      :should become apparent after a few melees or deaths.
      :
      :Command parser:
      :
      :   A command is one line of text terminated by a carriage return.
      :For reasons of simplicity, all words are distinguished by their
      :first six letters.  All others are ignored.  For example, typing
      :'DISASSEMBLE THE ENCYCLOPEDIA' is not only meaningless, it also
      :creates excess effort for your fingers.  Note that this trunca-
      :tion may produce ambiguities in the intepretation of longer words.
      :
      :   You are dealing with a fairly stupid parser, which understands
      :the following types of things--
      :
      :   Actions:
      :	Among the more obvious of these, such as TAKE, PUT, DROP, etc.
      :	Fairly general forms of these may be used, such as PICK UP,
      :	PUT DOWN, etc.
      :
      :   Directions:
      :	NORTH, SOUTH, UP, DOWN, etc. and their various abbreviations.
      :	Other more obscure directions (LAND, CROSS) are appropriate in
      :	only certain situations.
      :
      :   Objects:
      :	Most objects have names and can be referenced by them.
      :
      :   Adjectives:
      :	Some adjectives are understood and required when there are
      :	two objects which can be referenced with the same 'name' (e.g.,
      :	DOORs, BUTTONs).
      :
      :   Prepositions:
      :	It may be necessary in some cases to include prepositions, but
      :	the parser attempts to handle cases which aren't ambiguous
      :	without.  Thus 'GIVE CAR TO DEMON' will work, as will 'GIVE DEMON
      :	CAR'.  'GIVE CAR DEMON' probably won't do anything interesting.
      :	When a preposition is used, it should be appropriate;  'GIVE CAR
      :	WITH DEMON' won't parse.
      :
      :   Sentences:
      :	The parser understands a reasonable number of syntactic construc-
      :	tions.  In particular, multiple commands (separated by commas)
      :	can be placed on the same line.
      :
      :   Ambiguity:
      :	The parser tries to be clever about what to do in the case of
      :	actions which require objects that are not explicitly specified.
      :	If there is only one possible object, the parser will assume
      :	that it should be used.  Otherwise, the parser will ask.
      :	Most questions asked by the parser can be answered.
#00606:Welcome to Dungeon!
      :
      :   You are near a large dungeon, which is reputed to contain vast
      :quantities of treasure.   Naturally, you wish to acquire some of it.
      :In order to do so, you must of course remove it from the dungeon.  To
      :receive full credit for it, you must deposit it safely in the trophy
      :case in the living room of the house.
      :
      :   In addition to valuables, the dungeon contains various objects
      :which may or may not be useful in your attempt to get rich.  You may
      :need sources of light, since dungeons are often dark, and weapons,
      :since dungeons often have unfriendly things wandering about.  Reading
      :material is scattered around the dungeon as well;  some of it
      :is rumored to be useful.
      :
      :   To determine how successful you have been, a score is kept.
      :When you find a valuable object and pick it up, you receive a
      :certain number of points, which depends on the difficulty of finding
      :the object.  You receive extra points for transporting the treasure
      :safely to the living room and placing it in the trophy case.  In
      :addition, some particularly interesting rooms have a value associated
      :with visiting them.  The only penalty is for getting yourself killed,
      :which you may do only twice.
      :
      :   Of special note is a thief (always carrying a large bag) who
      :likes to wander around in the dungeon (he has never been seen by the
      :light of day).  He likes to take things.  Since he steals for pleasure
      :rather than profit and is somewhat sadistic, he only takes things which
      :you have seen.  Although he prefers valuables, sometimes in his haste
      :he may take something which is worthless.  From time to time, he examines
      :his take and discards objects which he doesn't like.  He may occas-
      :ionally stop in a room you are visiting, but more often he just wanders
      :through and rips you off (he is a skilled pickpocket).
#00832:Please answer the question.
#00836:You clearly are a suicidal maniac.  We don't allow psychotics in the
      :dungeon, since they may harm other adventurers.  Your remains will be
      :installed in the land of the living dead, where your fellow adventurers
      :may gloat over them.
#00865:What?  You don't trust me?  Why, only last week I patched a running
      :RSX system and it survived for over thirty seconds.  Oh, well.
#00882:Now let me see...
      :Well, we weren't quite able to restore your state.  You can't have
      :everything.
#00895:Do you wish me to try to patch you?
#00900:You are behind the white house.  In one corner of the house
      :there is a window which is #.
#00912:open
#00913:slightly ajar
#00915:You are in the kitchen of the white house.  A table seems to have
      :been used recently for the preparation of food.  A passage leads to
      :the west, and a dark staircase can be seen leading upward.  To the
      :east is a small window which is #.
#00945:You are in the living room.  There is a door to the east.  To the west
      :is a wooden door with strange gothic lettering, which appears to be
      :nailed shut.
#00964:You are in the living room.  There is a door to the east.  To the west
      :is a cyclops-shaped hole in an old wooden door, above which is some
      :strange gothic lettering.
#00985:In the center of the room is a large oriental rug.
#00992:In the center of the room is a closed trap door.
#00999:In the center of the room is an open trap door.
#01005:There is a rug lying next to an open trap door.
#01011:You are in a dark and damp cellar with a narrow passageway leading
      :east, and a crawlway to the south.  To the west is the bottom of a
      :steep metal ramp which is unclimbable.
#01033:The door crashes shut, and you hear someone barring it.
#01040:You are in a small room near the maze.  There are twisty
      :passages in the immediate vicinity.
#01052:Above you is a grating locked with a skull-and-crossbones lock.
#01060:Above you is an open grating with sunlight pouring in.
#01067:Above you is a grating.
#01070:You are in a clearing, with a forest surrounding you on the west
      :and south.
#01080:There is a grating securely fastened into the ground.
#01087:There is an open grating descending into darkness.
#01094:A grating appears on the ground.
#01099:You are in a long room on the south shore of a large reservoir.
#01107:You are in a long room, to the north of which was formerly a
      :reservoir.  However, with the water level lowered, there is merely
      :a wide stream running through the center of the room.
#01130:There is a western exit, a passageway south, and a steep pathway
      :climbing up along the edge of a cliff.
#01143:You are on the reservoir.  Beaches can be seen north and south.
      :Upstream a small stream enters the reservoir through a narrow
      :cleft in the rocks.  The dam can be seen downstream.
#01166:You are on what used to be a large reservoir, but which is now a
      :large mud pile.  There are 'shores' to the north and south.
#01182:You are in a large cavernous room, north of a large reservoir.
#01190:You are in a large cavernous room, to the south of which was formerly
      :a reservoir.  However, with the water level lowered, there is merely
      :a wide stream running through the center of the room.
#01215:There is a tunnel leaving the room to the north.
#01222:You are in a large room with giant icicles hanging from the walls
      :and ceiling.  There are passages to the north and east.
#01238:Part of the glacier has been melted.
#01243:There is a large passageway leading westward.
#01249:You are in a large square room with tall ceilings.  There are exits
      :on the north, east, and west sides of the room.  On the south wall is
      :an enormous mirror which fills the entire wall.
#01273:Unfortunately, you have managed to destroy it by your reckless
      :actions.
#01282:		BOOOOOOOOOM
#01284:You are in large room which seems to be air conditioned.  In one
      :corner there is a machine (?) which is shaped somewhat like a clothes
      :dryer.  On the 'panel' there is a switch which is labelled in an
      :obscure dialect of Swahili.  Fortunately, I know this dialect, and the
      :label translates to 'START'.  The switch does not appear to be manip-
      :ulable by any human hand (unless the fingers are about 1/16 by 1/4
      :inch).  On the front of the machine is a large lid, which is #.
#01343:closed
#01344:The cave is very windy at the moment, and your candles have blown out.
#01353:You are in a small room that has only one door, to the east.
#01361:In the corner of the room on the ceiling is a large vampire bat who
      :is obviously deranged and holding his nose.
#01375:A deranged vampire bat (a reject from WUMPUS) swoops down
      :from the ceiling and lifts you away...
#01388:You are at the periphery of a large dome, which forms the ceiling
      :of another room below.  Protecting you from a precipitous drop is a
      :wooden railing which circles the dome.
#01410:Hanging down from the railing is a rope which ends about ten feet
      :from the floor below.
#01421:I'm afraid that the leap you attempted has done you in.
#01428:You are in a large room with a prominent doorway leading to a down
      :staircase.  To the west is a narrow twisting tunnel.  Above you is a
      :large dome painted with scenes depicting elvish hacking rites.  Up
      :around the edge of the dome (20 feet up) is a wooden railing.  In the
      :center of the room there is a white marble pedestal.
#01469:A large piece of rope descends from the railing above, ending some
      :five feet above your head.
#01481:You are in a circular room with passages off in eight directions.
#01490:Your compass needle spins wildly, and you cannot get your bearings.
#01499:According to Prof. TAA of MIT Tech, the rapidly changing magnetic
      :fields in the room are so intense as to cause you to be electrocuted.
      :I really don't know, but in any event, something has killed you.
#01525:You are outside a large gateway, on which is inscribed:
      :
      :	"Abandon every hope, all ye who enter here."
      :
      :The gate is open.  Through it you can see a desolation, with a pile of
      :mangled corpses in one corner.  Thousands of voices, lamenting some
      :hideous fate, can be heard.
#01559:The way through the gate is barred by evil spirits, who jeer at your
      :attempts to pass.
#01570:There is a clap of thunder, and a voice echoes through the
      :cavern:  "Begone, chomper!"  Apparently, the voice thinks you
      :are an evil spirit and dismisses you from the land of the living.
#01594:You are not equipped for an exorcism.
#01599:There is a clap of thunder, and a voice echoes through the
      :cavern:  "Begone, fiends!"  The spirits, sensing the presense
      :of a greater power, flee through the walls.
#01620:You have entered the land of the living dead, a large desolate
      :room.  Although it is apparently uninhabited, you can hear the
      :sounds of thousands of lost souls weeping and moaning.  In
      :the east corner are stacked the remains of dozens of previous
      :adventurers who were less fortunate than yourself.  To the east
      :is an ornate passage, apparently recently constructed.
#01666:Amid the desolation, you spot what appears to be your head,
      :tastefully impaled on the end of a long pole.
#01680:You are standing on the top of flood control dam #3, which was
      :quite a tourist attraction in times far distant.  There are paths
      :to the north, south, east, and down.
#01701:The sluice gates on the dam are closed.  Behind the dam, there can
      :be seen a wide lake.  A small stream is formed by the runoff from
      :the lake.
#01719:It appears that the dam has been opened, since the water level behind
      :the dam is low and the sluice gate is open.  Water is rushing down-
      :stream through the gates.
#01740:There is a control panel here.  There is a large metal bolt on the
      :panel.  Above the bolt is a small green plastic bubble.
#01756:The green bubble is glowing.
#01760:The water level is now up to your ankles.
#01766:The water level is now up to your shins.
#01772:The water level is now up to your knees.
#01778:The water level is now up to your hips.
#01783:The water level is now up to your waist.
#01789:The water level is now up to your chest.
#01795:The water level is now up to your neck.
#01800:The water level is now over your head.
#01805:The water level is now high in your lungs.
#01811:The room is full of water and cannot be entered.
#01818:I'm afraid you have done drowned yourself.
#01824:You hear a scream of anguish as you violate the robber's hideaway.
      :Using passages unknown to you, he rushes to its defense.
#01840:The thief gestures mysteriously, and the treasures in the room
      :suddenly vanish.
#01850:Something seems funny about the feel of the buoy.
#01857:Oh dear, you seem to have gone over Aragain Falls.  Not a very
      :smart thing to do, apparently.
#01869:You seem to be digging a hole here.
#01874:The hole is getting deeper, but that's about it.
#01881:You are surrounded by a wall of sand on all sides.
#01888:You can see a small statue in the sand.
#01893:The wall collapses, smothering you.
#01898:There is nothing to dig into here.
#01903:You are digging into a pile of bat guano.
#01909:You seem to be getting knee deep in guano.
#01915:You are covered with bat turds, cretin.
#01920:This is getting you nowhere.
#01924:You are at the top of Aragain Falls, an enormous waterfall with a
      :drop of about 450 feet.  The only path here is on the north end.
      :There is a man-sized barrel here which you could fit into.
#01948:A beautiful rainbow can be seen over the falls and to the east.
#01956:A solid rainbow spans the falls.
#01961:According to Prof. TAA of MIT Tech, the rapidly changing magnetic
      :fields in the room are so intense as to fry all the delicate innards
      :of the robot.  I really don't know, but in any event, smoke is coming
      :out of its ears, and it has stopped moving.
#01993:You are on a wide ledge high into the volcano.  The rim of the
      :volcano is about 200 feet above, and there is a precipitous drop
      :below to the floor.
#02012:The way to the south is blocked by rubble.
#02018:There is a small door to the south.
#02023:You are in a dusty old room which is virtually featureless, except
      :for an exit on the north side.
#02036:Imbedded in the far wall is a rusty old box.  It appears that
      :the box is somewhat damaged, since an oblong hole has been
      :chipped out of the front of it.
#02056:On the far wall is a rusty box, whose door has been blown off.
#02064:You are in a room with a low ceiling which is circular in shape.
      :There are exits to the east and southeast.
#02078:As you enter, your compass starts spinning wildly.
#02085:The ledge has collapsed and cannot be landed on.
#02092:The ledge collapses, giving you a narrow escape.
#02099:The force of the explosion has caused the ledge to collapse belatedly.
#02108:The ledge collapses, leaving you with no place to land.
#02115:The ledge collapses, probably as a result of the explosion.  A large
      :chunk of it, which is attached to the hook, drags you down to the
      :ground.  Fatally.
#02135:The way is blocked by debris from an explosion.
#02141:You may recall your recent explosion.  Well, probably as a result of
      :that, you hear an ominous rumbling, as if one of the rooms in the
      :dungeon has collapsed.
#02161:The room trembles and 50,000 pounds of rock fall on you,
      :turning you into a pancake.
#02172:The house shakes, and the ceiling of the room you're in collapses,
      :turning you into a pancake.
#02184:A volcano gnome seems to walk straight out of the wall and says,
      :"I have a very busy appointment schedule and little time to waste on
      :trespassers, but for a very small fee, I'll show you the way out."
      :You notice that the gnome is nervously glancing at his watch.
#02217:Suddenly a sinister, wraithlike figure, cloaked and hooded, appears
      :seeming to float in the air before you.  In a low, almost inaudible
      :voice he says, "I welcome you to the ranks of the chosen of Zork.  You
      :have persisted through many trials and tests and have overcome them
      :all.  One such as yourself is fit to join even the implementers!"
      :He then raises his oaken staff and, chuckling, drifts away like a
      :wisp of smoke, his laughter fading in the distance.
#02275:Please forward problem reports and suggestions to:

      :   Attention:  Dungeon Maintenance
#02293:Unfortunately, it is impossible to tell directions in here.
#02301:The slag turns out to be rather insubstantial and crumbles into dust
      :at your touch.  It must not have been very valuable.
#02317:The lid opens.
#02319:The lid closes.
#02321:Look around.
#02323:You think it isn't?
#02326:I think you've already done that.
#02331:The trophy case is securely fastened to the wall (perhaps to foil any
      :attempt by robbers to remove it).
#02344:The bottle hits the far wall and is decimated.
#02350:The basket is at the other end of the chain.
#02356:A brilliant maneuver destroys the bottle.
#02362:The water splashes on the walls and evaporates immediately.
#02370:The water spills to the floor and evaporates immediately.
#02378:It is not tied to anything.
#02382:There is nothing it can be tied to.
#02387:The rope is already attached.
#02391:The rope drops over the side and comes within ten feet of the floor.
#02400:I see no objects here.
#02403:Although you tied it incorrectly, the rope becomes free.
#02411:The rope drops gently to the floor below.
#02417:The rope is tied to the railing.
#02422:The lamp has smashed into the floor, and the light has gone out.
#02431:The rug is too heavy to lift, but in trying to raise it you
      :notice an irregularity beneath it.
#02443:The rug is extremely heavy and cannot be carried.
#02450:With a great effort, the rug is moved to one side of the room.
      :With the rug moved, the dusty cover of a closed trap door appears.
#02467:Having moved the carpet previously, you find it impossible
      :to move it again.
#02477:You are stopped by a cloud of poisonous gas.
#02483:Time passes... and you die from some obscure poisoning.
#02490:The gnome glances at his watch.  "Oops!  I'm late for an
      :an appointment."  He disappears, leaving you alone on the shelf.
#02506:Now you've done it.  It seems that the brick has other properties
      :than weight, namely the ability to blow you to smithereens.
#02522:There is an explosion nearby.
#02526:The wire rapidly burns into nothing.
#02531:The match has gone out.
#02534:The lamp appears to be getting dimmer.
#02539:The lamp is dying.
#02542:The candles grow short.
#02545:The candles are very short.
#02549:The leaves burn, and the neighbors start to complain.
#02556:The sight of someone carrying a pile of burning leaves so offends
      :the neighbors that they come over and put you out.
#02571:As you pick up the rusty knife, your sword gives a single pulse
      :of blinding blue light.
#02582:As the knife approaches its victim, your mind is submerged by an
      :overmastering will.  Slowly, your hand turns, until the rusty blade
      :is an inch from your neck.  The knife seems almost to sing as it
      :savagely cuts your throat.
#02611:A ghost appears in the room and is appalled by your desecration
      :of the remains of a fellow adventurer.  He casts a curse on
      :all of your valuables and orders them banished to the land of
      :the living dead.  The ghost leaves, muttering obscenities.
#02642:There is a rumble from deep within the earth, and the room shakes.
#02651:There is an ugly person staring at you.
#02656:The mirror is broken into many pieces.
#02661:Nobody but a greedy surgeon would allow you to attempt that trick.
#02670:You have broken the mirror.  I hope you have a seven years supply of
      :good luck available.
#02682:Haven't you done enough already?
#02687:The torch hits the glacier and explodes into a great ball of flame,
      :devouring the glacier.  The water from the melting glacier rushes
      :downstream, carrying the torch with it.  In place of the glacier,
      :there is a passageway leading west.
#02717:The melting glacier seems to have carried the torch away, leaving
      :you in the dark.
#02728:The glacier is unmoved by your ridiculous attempt.
#02735:Part of the glacier melts, drowning you under a torrent of water.
#02744:burned out ivory torch
#02747:There is a burned out ivory torch here.
#02752:The basket is raised to the top of the shaft.
#02758:The basket is lowered to the bottom of the shaft.
#02765:The cage is securely fastened to the iron chain.
#02772:You seem unable to affect these spirits.
#02778:How can you attack a spirit with material objects?
#02785:The book is open to page 569.
#02789:As hard as you try, the book cannot be closed.
#02795:A booming voice says, "Wrong, cretin!", and you notice that you
      :have turned into a pile of dust.
#02808:I'm afraid that you have run out of matches.
#02814:One of the matches starts to burn.
#02819:The match is out.
#02822:The tube refuses to accept anything.
#02827:The cyclops yawns and stares at the thing that woke him.
#02835:The cyclops, tired of all your games and trickery, eats you.
      :The cyclops says, "Mmm mmm!  Just like mom used to make 'em."
#02851:The cyclops says, "Mmm mmm!  I love hot peppers!  But oh, could I use
      :a drink.  Perhaps I could drink the blood of that thing."  From the
      :gleam in his eye, it could be surmised that you are 'that thing'.
#02877:The cyclops looks tired and quickly falls fast asleep (what did you
      :put in that drink, anyway?).
#02890:The cyclops is apparently not thirsty at the moment and refuses
      :your generous gesture.
#02901:The cyclops may be hungry, but there is a limit.
#02908:The cyclops is not so stupid as to eat that!
#02914:The cyclops seems somewhat agitated.
#02919:The cyclops appears to be getting more agitated.
#02926:The cyclops is moving about the room, looking for something.
#02934:The cyclops was looking for salt and pepper.  I think he is gathering
      :condiments for his upcoming snack.
#02948:The cyclops is moving toward you in an unfriendly manner.
#02956:You have two choices:  1. Leave  2. Become dinner.
#02963:Your actions don't appear to be doing much harm to the cyclops, but
      :they do not exactly lower your insurance premiums, either.
#02979:The cyclops ignores all injuries to his body with a shrug.
#02987:The cyclops is rather heavy and doesn't take kindly to being grabbed.
#02996:You cannot tie the cyclops, although he is fit to be tied.
#03004:Realizing just in time that you'd be stabbed in the back if you
      :tried to take the chalice, you return to the fray.
#03019:Congratulations!  Unlike the other vandals, who merely stole the
      :artist's masterpieces, you have destroyed one.
#03033:worthless piece of canvas
#03037:There is a worthless piece of canvas here.
#03043:With great effort, you open the window far enough to allow passage.
#03052:The window closes (more easily than it opened).
#03058:The bolt won't turn with your best effort.
#03064:The sluice gates open, and water pours through the dam.
#03071:The sluice gates close, and water starts to collect behind the dam.
#03080:You can't do that!
#03083:The grating is locked.
#03086:The grating opens to reveal trees above you.
#03092:The grating opens.
#03095:The grating is unlocked.
#03099:The door reluctantly opens to reveal a rickety staircase descending
      :into darkness.
#03110:The door swings shut and closes.
#03115:The door is locked from above.
#03119:The door cannot be opened.
#03123:You cannot burn this door.
#03127:The door is invulnerable.
#03131:You cannot damage this door.
#03135:The door is still under warranty.
#03140:The machine comes to life (figuratively) with a dazzling display
      :of colored lights and bizarre noises.  After a few moments, the
      :excitement fades.
#03159:The machine doesn't seem to want to do anything.
#03166:A force keeps you from taking the bodies.
#03172:The voice of the guardian of the dungeon booms out from the darkness,
      :"Your disrespect has cost you your life!" and places your head on a pole.
#03190:The lights within the room shut off.
#03195:The lights within the room come on.
#03200:Click.
#03201:There is a rumbling sound, and a stream of water appears to burst
      :from the east wall of the room (apparently, a leak has occurred
      :in a pipe).
#03219:The blue button appears to be jammed.
#03224:The boat must be on the ground to be inflated.
#03230:The boat inflates and appears seaworthy.
#03236:You don't have enough lung power to inflate it.
#03242:This boat will not inflate since some cretin put a hole in it.
#03250:Well done.  The boat is repaired.
#03255:There is a hissing sound and the boat deflates.
#03261:The boat deflates.
#03264:You can't deflate the boat while you're in it.
#03270:The boat must be on the ground to be deflated.
#03276:Very good.
#03278:The rainbow seems to have become somewhat run of the mill.
#03286:Suddenly, the rainbow appears to become solid and, I venture,
      :walkable (I think the giveaway was the stairs and bannister).
#03302:The structural integrity of the rainbow seems to have declined
      :precipitously, leaving you about 450 feet in the air, supported
      :by water vapor.
#03320:The ballon is fastened to the hook.
#03325:The balloon is not tied to anything.
#03330:The wire falls off the hook.
#03334:The box is imbedded in the wall.
#03339:What do you expect, BOOM?
#03343:The box has no door!
#03346:The box is rusted and will not open.
#03351:The box is not open, chomper!
#03355:The wire starts to burn.
#03359:"Thank you very much," he says.  "I don't believe I've seen a
      :# as beautiful.  Follow me."  A door appears on the west end
      :of the ledge.  Through the door, you can see a narrow chimney
      :sloping downward.  The gnome moves quickly, and he disappears
      :from sight.
#03392:"That wasn't quite what I had in mind", he says, crunching
      :the # in his rock hard hands.
#03404:The gnome appears increasingly nervous.
#03409:Although the implementers are gone, they foresaw that some cretin
      :would tamper with their remains.  Therefore, they took steps to
      :prevent this.
#03427:Unfortunately, we've run out of poles.  Therefore, in punishment for
      :your transgression, we shall deprive you of all your valuables, and
      :of your life.
#03446:Congratulations!  You've managed to break all the bottles.  Fortunately
      :for your feet, they were made of magic glass and disappear immediately.
#03464:As you reach for the sphere, an iron cage falls from the ceiling
      :to entrap you.  To make matters worse, poisonous gas starts coming
      :into the room.
#03483:As the robot reaches for sphere, an iron cage falls from the
      :ceiling.  The robot attempts to fend it off but is trapped below it.
      :Alas, the robot short circuits in his vain attempt to escape and
      :crushes the sphere beneath him as he falls to the floor.
#03515:There is a giant spark, and you are fried to a crisp.
#03522:Nothing seems to happen.
#03526:The whirring increases in intensity slightly.
#03532:The whirring decreases in intensity slightly.
#03538:A dull thump is heard in the distance.
#03543:The flask breaks into pieces.
#03547:Here noxious vapors prevent your entry.
#03552:Just before you pass out, you notice that the vapors from the
      :flask's contents are fatal.
#03564:Suddenly, the room appears to have become very large.
#03571:The only writing visible is a capital E.  The rest is too small to
      :be clearly visible.
#03582:You can't see through that!
#03586:The letters appear larger but are still too small to read.
#03594:The icing, now visible, says "EXPLODE".
#03599:The icing, now visible, says "EVAPORATE".
#03605:The icing, now visible, says "ENLARGE".
#03610:The pool of water evaporates, revealing a tin of rare spices.
#03618:The door to the room seems to be blocked by sticky orange rubble
      :from an explosion.  Probably some careless adventurer was playing
      :with blasting cakes.
#03637:You have been blasted to smithereens (whatever they are).
#03645:The room around you seems to be getting smaller.
#03652:The room seems to have become too small to hold you.  It seems
      :that the walls are not as compressable as your body, which is
      :more or less demolished.
#03671:The robot is injured (being of shoddy construction) and falls to the
      :floor in a pile of garbage, which disintegrates before your eyes.
#03688:How romantic!
#03690:If you must... Poof, you're dead!
#03695:The grue is a sinister, lurking presence in the dark places of the
      :earth.  Its favorite diet is adventurers, but its insatiable
      :appetite is tempered by its fear of light.  No grue has ever been
      :seen by the light of day, and few have survived its fearsome jaws
      :to tell the tale.
#03730:There is no grue here, but I'm sure there is at least one lurking in
      :the darkness nearby.  I wouldn't let my light go out if I were you!
#03748:The bucket rises and comes to a stop.
#03753:The bucket descends and comes to a stop.
#03759:You notice that the # has burned out, and that
      :the cloth bag is starting to deflate.
#03770:I hope you have more light than from a #.
#03776:I didn't realize that adventurers are stupid enough to light a
      :# in a room which reeks of coal gas.  Fortunately,
      :there is still justice in the world.
#03795:Oh, dear.  It appears that the smell coming from this room was coal
      :gas.  I would have thought twice about carrying a # in here.
#03812:There is now a puddle in the middle of the #.
#03818:The water leaks out of the # and evaporates immediately.
#03826:You won't melt it with a #.
#03830:The bolt can't be turned with your #.
#03835:It seems that a # won't do.
#03839:With a #?
#03841:The robot gladly takes the # and nods his headlike
      :appendage in thanks.
#03850:A #?  Surely you jest.
#03853:He who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is not fit for the
      :kingdom of winners.  In any case, 'BACK' doesn't work.
#03869:You'll have to speak up if you expect me to hear you.
#03876:I don't know how to do that.  I win in all cases.
#03883:At your service!
#03886:The Frobozz Company, Ltd., created, owns, and operates this dungeon.
#03895:Well, FOO, BAR, and BLETCH to you too!
#03900:It could very well be too late.
#03904:The dungeon is ALWAYS open (always room for one more).
#03911:Naturally!
#03913:AAAARRRRRRGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHH!
#03917:Very good.  Now you can go to the second grade.
#03923:Have you tried hopping around the dungeon, too?
#03929:Are you enjoying yourself?
#03933:Wheeeeee!
#03935:Do you expect me to applaud?
#03939:Such language in a high-class establishment like this!
#03946:You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
#03951:It's not so bad.  You could have been killed already.
#03958:Tough shit, asshole.
#03961:Oh, dear.  Such language from a supposedly winning adventurer!
#03969:That word is henceforth replaced with DUNGEON.
#03975:I think you are taking this thing for granite.
#03981:Brief descriptions.
#03984:Maximum verbosity.
#03987:No long descriptions.
#03990:You can see:  A #.
#03993:Swimming is not allowed in this dungeon.
#03999:I don't really see how.
#04002:I think that swimming is best performed in water.
#04009:Perhaps it is your head that is swimming.
#04015:Wasn't he an Indian?
#04018:I didn't think you would really try to go over the falls in a
      :barrel.  It seems that some 450 feet below, you were met by a number
      :of unfriendly rocks and boulders, causing your immediate demise.
#04043:Wasn't he a sailor?
#04046:The cyclops, hearing the name of his deadly nemesis, flees the room
      :by knocking down the wall on the north side of the room.
#04062:There is a clap of thunder and the east door opens.
#04069:Well what?
#04071:If you pray enough, your prayers may be answered.
#04078:Nothing happens.
#04081:I don't really know how to do that.
#04086:Do you wish to leave the game?
#04090:Underneath the pile of leaves is a grating.
#04096:Underneath the rug is a closed trap door.
#04102:Hello.
#04103:Good day.
#04105:Nice weather we've been having lately.
#04110:Goodbye.
#04112:Here, nothing happens.
#04115:Nothing happens here.
#04118:I think that phrase is getting a bit worn out.
#04124:You seem to be repeating yourself.
#04129:The # bows his head to you in greeting.
#04134:I think that only schizophrenics say hello to a #.
#04141:It is impossible to read in the dark.
#04146:How does one look through a #?
#04150:How can I read a #?
#04153:How, exactly, do I ring that?
#04157:Ding, dong.
#04159:I'm not sure that a # can be melted.
#04164:If you wish, but I can't understand why.
#04170:Dental hygiene is highly recommended, but I'm not sure what
      :you want to brush them with.
#04182:A nice idea, but with a #?
#04186:Well, you seem to have been brushing your teeth with some sort of
      :glue.  As a result, your mouth gets glued together with your nose,
      :and you die of respiratory failure.
#04208:Unfortunately, the troll can't hear you.
#04214:Inflating it further would probably burst it.
#04220:How can you inflate that?
#04224:Come on, now!
#04226:The # isn't sleeping.
#04229:This has no effect.
#04232:does not seem to do anything useful
#04237:is not notably useful
#04240:isn't very interesting
#04243:doesn't appear worthwhile
#04247:has no effect
#04249:doesn't do anything
#04252:Kicking a # #.
#04254:Waving a # #.
#04256:Playing in this way with a # #.
#04260:Fiddling with a # #.
#04263:Pushing the # #.
#04266:I don't think so.
#04269:This cannot be tied, so it cannot be untied!
#04275:How can you tie that to anything?
#04280:You can't tie the # to that.
#04284:You could certainly never tie the # with that!
#04290:The # struggles and you cannot tie him up.
#04296:Why would you tie up a #?
#04300:You can't turn that.
#04303:You certainly can't turn it with a #.
#04308:Digging with the # is slow and tedious.
#04313:Digging with a # is silly.
#04317:I don't think that anybody is home.
#04322:Why knock on a #?
#04325:It sounds like there is something inside the #.
#04331:The contents of the # spill out.
#04336:I can't get to that to move it.
#04340:You can't move the #.
#04343:You can't turn that on.
#04346:It is already on.
#04349:You can't turn that off.
#04353:It is already off.
#04356:The # is now on.
#04359:The # is now off.
#04362:It is now pitch black.
#04365:You must tell me how to do that to a #.
#04370:The # cannot be opened.
#04373:Opened.
#04374:Opening the # reveals:
#04377:The # cannot be closed.
#04380:It is already open.
#04383:It is already closed.
#04386:Closed.
#04387:There is a # here.
#04390:You are carrying a #.
#04393:It is in the #, which is in the room.
#04398:It is in the #, which you are carrying.
#04403:Time passes...
#04405:The # must be on the ground to be boarded.
#04411:I suppose you have a theory on boarding a #.
#04417:You are already in the #, cretin!
#04422:You are now in the #.
#04425:You aren't in that!
#04428:You realize, just in time, that disembarking here would probably
      :be fatal.
#04438:You are on your own feet again.
#04442:You can't go there without a vehicle.
#04447:You can't go there in a #.
#04451:I see nothing special about the #.
#04456:It is pitch dark.  You are likely to be eaten by a grue.
#04464:You are in the #.
#04467:The # has died.
#04469:The troll, disarmed, cowers in terror, pleading for his life in
      :the guttural tongue of the trolls.
#04482:The troll, now worried about this encounter, recovers his
      :bloody axe.
#04491:An unconscious troll is sprawled on the floor.  All passages out
      :of the room are open.
#04502:A nasty-looking troll, brandishing a bloody axe, blocks all passages
      :out of the room.
#04513:The troll stirs, quickly resuming a fighting stance.
#04520:The troll spits in your face, saying "Better luck next time".
#04528:The troll laughs at your puny gesture.
#04533:The troll, who is remarkably coordinated, catches the #
#04540:The troll, who is not overly proud, graciously accepts the gift
#04548:and not having the most discriminating tastes, gleefully eats it.
#04557:and being for the moment sated, throws it back.  Fortunately, the
      :troll has poor control, and the knife falls on the floor.  He does
      :not look pleased.
#04576:Sadly, a # can't be put in a #.
#04580:You can't take the #.
#04583:Aren't you forgetting something?
#04588:That would be a good trick.
#04592:The # is too big to jump over.
#04596:You should have looked before you leaped.
#04602:I'm afraid that leap was a bit much for your weak frame.
#04610:In the movies, your life would be passing in front of your eyes.
#04619:Geronimo...
#04621:I don't think that the # would agree with you.
#04627:I think you should get that first.
#04632:Thank you very much.  It really hit the spot.
#04638:How can I drink that?
#04641:I'd like to, but I can't get to that.
#04646:Thank you very much.  I was rather thirsty, probably from all
      :this talking.
#04656:The # catches fire.
#04659:Unfortunately, you were holding it at the time.
#04665:You don't have that.
#04668:The # catches fire and is consumed.
#04673:I don't think you can burn a #.
#04677:It doesn't seem to work.
#04681:Can you unlock a grating with a #?
#04686:Munging a # #.
#04688:Trying to kill a # #.
#04691:Trying to attack a # #.
#04694:There is nothing here to attack.
#04699:I've known strange people, but attacking a #?
#04705:with your bare hands is suicidal
#04710:with that is very self-destructive
#04715:You are in perfect health.
#04719:You have a light wound.
#04722:You have a serious wound.
#04726:You have several wounds.
#04730:You have serious wounds.
#04734:You are at death's door.
#04738:You can be killed by one more light wound.
#04744:You can be killed by a serious wound.
#04749:You can survive one serious wound.
#04754:You are strong enough to take several wounds.
#04760:You have been killed once.
#04764:You have been killed twice.
#04768:This gives you the rank of Cheater.
#04773:This gives you the rank of Wizard.
#04778:This gives you the rank of Master.
#04783:This gives you the rank of Winner.
#04788:This gives you the rank of Hacker.
#04793:This gives you the rank of Adventurer.
#04798:This gives you the rank of Junior Adventurer.
#04804:This gives you the rank of Novice Adventurer.
#04810:This gives you the rank of Amateur Adventurer.
#04816:This gives you the rank of Beginner.
#04821:Your sword is no longer glowing.
#04826:Your sword is glowing with a faint blue glow.
#04832:You sword has begun to glow very brightly.
#04838:Annoyed to be left unarmed in such an obviously dangerous
      :neighborhood, the thief slips off into the shadows.
#04852:The robber, somewhat surprised by this turn of events, nimbly
      :recovers his stilletto.
#04863:His booty remains.
#04866:As the thief dies, the power of his magic decreases, and his
      :treasures reappear:  A #.
#04877:  A #.
#04878:There is a suspicious-looking individual, holding a bag, leaning
      :against one wall.  He is armed with a vicious-looking stilletto.
#04895:There is a suspicious-looking individual lying unconscious on the
      :ground.  His bag and stilletto seem to have vanished.
#04910:The robber revives, briefly feigning continued unconsciousness, and
      :when he sees his moment, scrambles away from you.
#04925:Once you got him, what would you do with him?
#04931:You missed.  The thief makes no attempt to take the knife, although
      :it would be a fine addition to the collection in his bag.  He does
      :seem angered by your attempt.
#04952:You evidently frightened the robber, although you missed him.  He flees.
#04962:You evidently frightened the robber, although you missed him.  He flees,
      :but the contents of his bag fall on the floor.
#04977:Your proposed victim suddenly recovers consciousness.
#04984:The thief seems rather offended by your offer.  Do you think he's as
      :stupid as you are?
#04995:The thief places the # in his bag and thanks you politely.
#05003:The candles are not lit.
#05007:The flame is extinguished.
#05011:Alas, there's not much left of the candles.  Certainly not enough to
      :burn.
#05021:With what?
#05023:The candles are lit.
#05026:The candles are already lit.
#05030:You have to light them with something that's burning, you know.
#05038:You realize just in time that the candles are already lit.
#05046:The heat from the torch is so intense that the candles are vaporized.
#05055:Oh, no!  You walked into the slavering fangs of a lurking grue.
#05063:Oh, no!  A fearsome grue slithered into the room and devoured you.
#05072:You can't go that way.
#05075:The # is closed.
#05078:I can't reach that.
#05081:You aren't carrying that.
#05085:Dropped.
#05087:Thrown.
#05088:You watch as the balloon slowly lands.
#05093:The balloon has landed.
#05096:You have landed, but the balloon did not survive.
#05103:You watch as the balloon slowly descends.
#05109:The balloon descends.
#05112:You hear a boom and notice that the balloon is falling to the ground.
#05121:Your balloon has hit the rim of the volcano, ripping the cloth and
      :causing you to drop 500 feet.  Did you get your flight insurance?
#05138:You watch as the balloon slowly ascends.
#05144:The balloon ascends.
#05147:You watch as the balloon slowly floats away.  It seems to be ascending,
      :due to its light load.
#05159:The balloon leaves the ledge.
#05163:You watch as the balloon slowly lifts off.
#05169:The balloon slowly rises from the ground.
#05175:The cloth bag is draped over the side.
#05180:The balloon is inflated, and there is a # burning
      :in the receptacle.
#05189:The balloon is tied to the hook.
#05194:I'm afraid you can't control the balloon in that way.
#05201:You are tied to the ledge.
#05205:You don't really want to hold a burning #.
#05211:The receptacle is already occupied.
#05216:The # burns inside the receptacle.
#05221:The balloon inflates as it fills with hot air.
#05227:Not likely.
#05229:An interesting idea, but...
#05233:A valiant attempt.
#05236:You can't be serious.
#05239:Not a prayer.
#05241:You already have it.
#05244:Your load is too heavy.  You will have to leave something behind.
#05253:Taken.
#05254:Nice try.
#05256:I can't do that.
#05259:I can't reach inside.
#05262:How can you do that?
#05265:The # is already in the #.
#05269:It won't fit.
#05271:I can't reach the #.
#05274:The cage shakes and is hurled across the room.
#05280:"I am sorry but that action is difficult in the absense of a mouth."
#05289:"My vision is not that good without eyes."
#05295:"I am only a stupid robot and cannot perform that command."
#05303:ECHO
      :The acoustics of the room change subtly.
#05309:Almost as soon as the # breathes his last, a cloud of
      :sinister black smoke envelops him, and when the fog lifts, the
      :carcass has disappeared.
#05327:The # contains:
#05329:Your collection of treasures consists of:
#05335:You are carrying:
#05338:The # is carrying:
#05341:By some miracle of elven technology, you have managed to
      :stop the leak in the dam.
#05352:You are empty handed.
#05355:It is too dark in here to see.
#05359:#:
#05360:I could't find anything.
#05364:I couldn't find any valuables.
#05368:Someone carrying a large bag is casually leaning against one of the
      :walls here.  He does not speak, but it is clear from his aspect that
      :the bag will be taken only over his dead body.
#05391:Your opponent, determining discretion to be the better part of
      :valor, decides to terminate this little contretemps.  With a rueful
      :nod of his head, he steps backward into the gloom and disappears.
#05416:The holder of the large bag just left, looking disgusted.
      :Fortunately, he took nothing.
#05427:A 'lean and hungry' gentleman just wandered through.  Finding
      :nothing of value, he left disgruntled.
#05440:A seedy-looking individual with a large bag just wandered through
      :the room.  On the way, he quietly abstracted all valuables from the
      :room and from your possession, mumbling something about, "Do unto
      :others before...".
#05468:The other occupant (he of the large bag), finding nothing of value,
      :left disgusted.
#05479:The other occupant just left carrying his large bag.  You may not
      :have noticed that he robbed you blind first.
#05493:Off in the distance you hear someone saying, "My, I wonder what this
      :fine # is doing here?"
#05505:You are still recovering from the last blow, so your attack is
      :ineffective.
#05515:Attacking a dead # is pointless.
#05520:Well, you really did it that time.  Is suicide painless?
#05528:The # slowly regains his feet.
#05532:The unconscious # cannot defend himself:  he dies.
#05539:It appears that the last blow was too much for you.  I'm afraid
      :that you are dead.
#05550:Saved.
#05551:I can't access the save file.
#05555:Restored.
#05557:Your save file is obsolete and cannot be restored.
#05564:I don't understand that.
#05568:You cannot talk to that!
#05572:You cannot talk through another person.
#05577:Please input the entire command again.
#05582:Fortunately, you still have a #.
#05587:You are in a room with an exit on the west side, and a staircase
      :leading up.
#05597:A cyclops, who looks prepared to eat horses (much less mere
      :adventurers), blocks the staircase.  From his state of health
      :and the bloodstains on the wall, you gather that he is not very
      :friendly, though he likes people.
#05625:The cyclops is standing in the corner, eyeing you closely.  I don't
      :think he likes you very much.  He looks extremely hungry, even for
      :a cyclops.
#05644:The cyclops, having eaten the hot peppers, appears to be gasping.
      :His enflamed tongue protrudes from his man-sized mouth.
#05660:The cyclops, perhaps affected by a drug in your drink, is sleeping
      :blissfully at the foot of the stairs.
#05674:On the north of the room is a wall which used to be solid, but which
      :now has a cyclops-shaped hole in it.
#05688:The bottle is closed.
#05691:The bottle is already full.
#05695:The bottle is now full of water.
#05700:The water slips through your fingers.
#05705:Too many prepositions.
#05708:Too many objects.
#05711:I can't see one here.
#05714:Which one do you mean?
#05717:I can't reach that from inside the #.
#05722:What should I do with the #?
#05726:Huh?
#05727:You must supply a direct object.
#05732:You must supply an indirect object.
#05737:Normally, I would offer to patch you up, but I'm ashamed to say my
      :abilities are not equal to dealing with your present condition.
      :Please let me express my profoundest regrets.
#05760:The thief, being temporarily incapacitated, is unable to acknowledge
      :your greeting with his usual graciousness.
#05774:The thief is taken aback by your unexpected generosity but accepts
      :the # and stops to admire its beauty.
#05788:The # is open, but I can't tell what's beyond it.
#05795:The # is empty.
#05797:I don't know how to look inside a #.
#05802:There is nothing interesting there.
#05807:The implementers are dead;  therefore, they do not respond.
#05815:You can't wind a #.
#05818:You hear in the distance the chirping of a song bird.
#05825:A metallic voice says, "Hello, Intruder!  Your unauthorized presence
      :in the vault area of the Bank of Zork has set off all sorts of nasty
      :surprises, several of which seem to have been fatal.  This message
      :brought to you by the Frobozz Magic Alarm Company."
#05858:An epicene Gnome of Zurich, wearing a three-piece suit and carrying a
      :safety deposit box, materializes in the room.  "You seem to have
      :forgotten to deposit your valuables," he says, tapping the lid of the
      :box impatiently.  "We don't usually allow customers to use the boxes
      :here, but we can make this ONE exception, I suppose..."  He looks
      :askance at you over his wire-rimmed bifocals.
#05907:The gnome looks impatient:  "I may have another customer waiting;
      :you'll just have to fend for yourself, I'm afraid."  He disappears,
      :leaving you alone in the bare room.
#05929:Talk about eating rich foods!
#05933:Nothing like having money to burn!
#05938:"I wouldn't put THAT in a safety deposit box," remarks the gnome with
      :disdain, tossing it over his shoulder, where it disappears with an
      :understated "pop".
#05958:The gnome carefully places the # in the
      :deposit box.  "Let me show you the way out," he says, making it clear
      :that he will be pleased to see the last of you.  Then, you are momentarily
      :disoriented, and when you recover, you are back at the Bank Entrance.
#05990:The gnome says, "Well, I never!" and disappears with a snap of his
      :fingers, leaving you alone.
#06002:The gnome appears increasingly impatient.
#06008:There is an unpleasant grinding noise from inside the canary.
#06016:The canary chirps blithely, if somewhat tinnily, for a short time.
#06025:The canary chirps, slightly off key, an aria from a forgotten opera.
      :From out of the greenery flies a lovely song bird.  It perches on a
      :limb just over your head and opens its beak to sing.  As it does so,
      :a beautiful brass bauble drops from its mouth, bounces off the top
      :of your head, and lands glimmering in the grass.  As the canary winds
      :down, the song bird flies away.
#06072:The cliff is too steep for climbing.
#06077:The egg is already open.
#06081:There is no obvious way to open the egg.
#06087:I doubt you could do that without damaging it.
#06093:The egg is now open, but the clumsiness of your attempt has
      :seriously diminished its esthetic appeal.
#06106:The concept of using a # is certainly original.
#06112:Not to say that using a # isn't original either...
#06119:You rather indelicate handling of the egg has caused it some damage.
      :The egg is now open.
#06131:Climbing the walls is of no avail.
#06136:Bizarre!
#06138:The egg falls to the ground and is seriously damaged.
#06145:The # falls to the ground.
#06149:You are about ten feet above the ground nestled among some large
      :branches.  The nearest branch above you is beyond your reach.
#06165:On the ground below you can see:
#06170:I can't see any wall here.
#06174:That cannot be turned.
#06177:You would be lost without me.
#06181:You don't have the #.
#06184:The song bird is not here, but it is probably nearby.
#06191:I can't see any song bird here.
#06195:You feel somewhat disoriented as you pass through...
#06202:You hit your head against the # as you attempt this feat.
#06210:You can't go more than part way through the curtain.
#06217:That would involve quite a contortion!
#06222:You are in it, turkey!
#06225:As you try, your hand seems to go through it.
#06231:The # goes through it.
#06234:The # passes through the wall and vanishes.
#06240:The curtain dims slightly as the # passes through.
#06247:I can't do that with everything at once.
#06253:There is a wall there.
#06256:There is no way up.
#06259:There is no way down.
#06262:You are in part of the long hallway.  The east and west walls are
      :dressed stone.  In the center of the hall is a shallow stone channel.
      :In the center of the room the channel widens into a large hole around
      :which is engraved a compass rose.
#06292:Somewhat to the south, identical stone statues face each other from
      :pedestals on opposite sides of the corridor.  The statues represent
      :Guardians of Zork, a military order of ancient lineage.  They are
      :portrayed as heavily armored warriors standing at ease, hands clasped
      :around formidable bludgeons.
#06330:Somewhat to the north, identical stone statues face each other from
      :pedestals on opposite sides of the corridor.  The statues represent
      :Guardians of Zork, a military order of ancient lineage.  They are
      :portrayed as heavily armored warriors standing at ease, hands clasped
      :around formidable bludgeons.
#06368:A passage enters from the south.
#06373:The Guardians awake and, in perfect unison, destroy you with
      :their stone bludgeons.  Satisfied, they resume their posts.
#06389:To the north and south are large hallways.
#06395:To the north is a large hallway.
#06400:You are inside a rectangular box of wood whose structure is rather
      :complicated.  Four sides and the roof are filled in, and the floor
      :is open.
      :   As you face the side opposite the entrance, two short sides of
      :carved and polished wood are to your left and right.  The left panel
      :is mahogany, the right pine.  The wall you face is red on its left
      :half and black on its right.  On the entrance side, the wall is white
      :opposite the red part of the wall it faces, and yellow opposite the
      :black section.  The painted walls are at least twice the length of
      :the unpainted ones.  The ceiling is painted blue.
      :   In the floor is a stone channel about six inches wide and a foot
      :deep.  The channel is oriented in a north-south direction.  In the
      :exact center of the room the channel widens into a circular
      :depression perhaps two feet wide.  Incised in the stone around this
      :area is a compass rose.
      :   Running from one short wall to the other at about waist height
      :is a wooden bar, carefully carved and drilled.  This bar is pierced
      :in two places.  The first hole is in the center of the bar (and thus
      :in the center of the room).  The second is at the left end of the room
      :(as you face opposite the entrance).  Through each hole runs a wooden
      :pole.
      :   The pole at the left end of the bar is short, extending about a
#06563:foot above the bar, and ends in a hand grip.  The pole is resting on
      :the stone floor.
#06574:foot above the bar, and ends in a hand grip.  The pole has been
      :dropped into a hole carved in the stone floor.
#06588:foot above the bar, and ends in a hand grip.  The pole has been lifted
      :out of a hole carved in the stone floor.  There is evidently enough
      :friction to keep the pole from dropping back down.
#06612:foot above the bar, and ends in a hand grip.  The pole has been
      :dropped into the stone channel incised in the floor.
#06627:foot above the bar, and ends in a hand grip.  The pole is positioned
      :above the stone channel in the floor.
#06641:   The long pole at the center of the bar extends from the ceiling
      :through the bar to the circular area in the stone channel.  The
      :bottom end of this pole has a T-bar a bit less than two feet long
      :attached to it.  On the T-bar is carved an arrow.  The arrow and
      :T-bar are pointing #.

#06689:You are in a small room, with narrow passages exiting to the north
      :and south.  A narrow red beam of light crosses the room at the north
      :end, inches above the floor.
#06710:You are in a small room, with narrow passages exiting to the north
      :and south.  A narrow red beam of light crosses the room at the north
      :end, inches above the floor.  The beam is stopped halfway across the
      :room by a # lying on the floor.
#06740:Though large and esthetically pleasing, the crypt is empty;  the
      :sarcophagi, bodies, and rich treasures to be expected in a tomb of
      :this magnificence are missing.  Inscribed on the wall is the motto of
      :the implementers, "Feel Free".  There is a door leading out of the
      :crypt to the south.  The door is #.
#06779:You are in an east-west corridor which turns north at its eastern
      :and western ends.  The walls of the corridor are marble.  An
      :additional passage leads south at the center of the corridor.
#06803:In the center of the north wall of the passage is a bronze door
      :which is #.
#06813:You are in a narrow north-south corridor.  At the south end is a door
      :and at the north end is an east-west corridor.  The door is #.
#06830:You are in a north-south hallway which ends in a large wooden door.
#06839:The wooden door has a barred panel in it at about head height.  The
      :panel is #, and the door is #.
#06852:You are in a large east-west corridor which opens out to a northern
      :parapet at its center.  You can see flames and smoke as you peer
      :towards the parapet.  The corridor turns south at its east and west
      :ends, and due south is a massive wooden door.  In the door is a small
      :window barred with iron.  The door is #.
#06891:You are standing behind a stone retaining wall which rims a large
      :parapet overlooking a fiery pit.  It is difficult to see through the
      :smoke and flame which fills the pit, but it seems to be more or less
      :bottomless.  It also extends upwards out of sight.  The pit itself
      :is of roughly dressed stone and is circular in shape.  It is about
      :two hundred feet in diameter.  The flames generate considerable heat,
      :so it is rather uncomfortable standing here.
      :   There is an object here which looks like a sundial.  On it are
      :an indicator arrow and (in the center) a large button.  On the face
      :of the dial are numbers "one" through "eight".  The indicator points
      :to the number "#".
#06976:one
#06977:two
#06978:three
#06979:four
#06980:five
#06981:six
#06982:seven
#06983:eight
#06984:You are in a featureless prison cell.  You can see only the flames
      :and smoke from the pit out of the small window in the closed door
      :in front of you.
#07003:You are in a featureless prison cell.  You can see the east-west
      :corridor outside the open wooden door in front of you.
#07018:Behind you is a bronze door which seems to be #.
#07025:You are in a featureless prison cell.  Its wooden door is securely
      :fastened, and you can see only the flames and smoke of the pit out
      :its small window.
#07044:You are in a featureless prison cell.  Its wooden door is securely
      :fastened, and you can see only the flames and smoke of the pit out
      :its small window.  On the other side of the cell is a bronze door
      :which seems to be #.
#07072:   As you gleefully examine your new-found riches, the dungeon
      :master himself materializes beside you and says, "Now that you have
      :solved all the mysteries of the dungeon, it is time for you to assume
      :your rightfully-earned place in the scheme of things.  Long have I
      :waited for one capable of releasing me from my burden!"  He taps you
      :lightly on the head with his staff and mumbles a few well-chosen spells.
      :You feel yourself changing, growing older and more stooped.  For a
      :moment there are two identical mages staring at each other among the
      :treasures, then you watch as your counterpart dissolves into a mist
      :and disappears, a sardonic grin on his face.
#07155:Suddenly, as you wait in the dark, you begin to feel somewhat
      :disoriented.  The feeling passes, but something seems different.
      :As you regain your composure, the cloaked figure appears before you
      :and says, "You are now ready to face the ultimate challenge of
      :Zork.  Should you wish to do this somewhat more quickly in the
      :future, you will be given a magic phrase which will at any time
      :transport you by magic to this point.  To select the phrase, say
      :	INCANT, <word>
      :and you will be told your own magic phrase to use by saying
      :	INCANT, <phrase>
      :Good luck, and choose wisely!"
#07227:The button pops back to its original position.
#07233:The mirror quietly swings shut.
#07237:The pine wall closes quietly.
#07241:The structure shakes slightly but doesn't move.
#07247:The short pole prevents the structure from rotating.
#07254:The movement of the structure alerts the Guardians.
#07261:The arrow on the compass rose now indicates #.
#07267:The structure rocks back and forth slightly but doesn't move.
#07275:The pine wall swings open.
#07279:The pine door opens into the field of view of the Guardians.
#07287:The structure has reached the end of the stone channel and won't
      :budge.
#07296:The structure slides # and stops over another compass rose.
#07304:The structure wobbles # and stops over another compass rose.
#07312:The structure wobbles as it moves, alerting the Guardians.
#07320:The Guardian notices a wooden structure creeping by, and his
      :suspicions are aroused.
#07331:Suddenly, the Guardians realize that someone is trying to sneak by
      :them in the structure.  They awake and, in perfect unison, hammer
      :the box and its contents (including you) to a pulp.  Satisfied, they
      :resume their posts.
#07359:A Guardian notices the open side of the structure, and his suspicions
      :are aroused.
#07370:Attacking the Guardians is about as futile as attacking a stone wall.
      :Unfortunately for you, your futile blow attracts their attention, and
      :they manage to dispatch you effortlessly.
#07393:The statues are impassive.
#07397:The dungeon master is taken momentarily by surprise.  He dodges your
      :blow and then, with a disappointed expression on his face, he raises
      :his staff and traces a complicated pattern in the air.  As it
      :completes you crumble into dust.
#07427:"I'm willing to accompany you, but not to ride in your pocket!"
#07435:The pole is now slightly above the floor.
#07441:The pole cannot be raised further.
#07446:The pole cannot be lowered further.
#07451:The pole is lowered into the channel.
#07456:The pole is lowered into the stone hole.
#07462:The pole is already resting on the floor.
#07468:The pole now rests on the stone floor.
#07473:The button becomes depressed.
#07477:The button pops back out.
#07481:The button is already depressed.
#07486:No doubt you have a bottle of moonbeams as well.
#07493:The beam is now interrupted by a # lying on the floor.
#07500:You can't break the beam with a #.
#07505:The # already breaks the beam.
#07509:I see no bronze door here.
#07513:The bronze door opens.
#07516:The bronze door closes.
#07519:On the other side of the door is a narrow passage which opens out
      :into a larger area.
#07530:The door won't budge.
#07533:The knock reverberates along the hall.  For a time it seems there
      :will be no answer.  Then you hear someone unlatching the small wooden
      :panel.  Through the bars of the great door, the wrinkled face of an
      :old man appears.  He gazes down at you and intones as follows:
      :   "I am the master of the dungeon, whose task it is to insure
      :that none but the most scholarly and masterful adventurers are
      :admitted into the secret realms of the dungeon.  To ascertain whether
      :you meet the stringent requirements laid down by the Great
      :Implementers, I will ask three questions which should be easy for
      :one of your reputed excellence to answer.  You have undoubtedly
      :discovered the answers during your travels through the dungeon.
      :Should you answer each of these questions correctly within five
      :attempts, then I am obliged to acknowledge your skill and daring and
      :admit you to these regions.
      :   "All answers should be in the form 'ANSWER, <answer>'."
#07650:The booming voice asks:
#07653:"From which room can one enter the robber's hideaway without passing
      :through the cyclops room?"
#07665:"Beside the Temple, to which room is it possible to go from the Altar?"
#07674:"What is the absolute minimum specified value of the Zorkmid
      :treasures, in Zorkmids?"
#07685:"What object is of use in determining the function of the iced cakes?"
#07694:"What can be done to the mirror that is useful?"
#07701:"The taking of which object offends the ghosts?"
#07708:"What object in the dungeon is haunted?"
#07714:"In which room is the phrase 'Hello sailor' useful?"
#07721:The door is securely fastened.
#07725:The wooden door opens.
#07728:The wooden door closes.
#07731:The dungeon master says, "I will stay."
#07736:The dungeon master says, "I will follow."
#07742:There is no reply.
#07745:"I prefer to stay where I am, thank you."
#07751:"I am not permitted to enter the prison cell."
#07757:"I cannot perform that action for you."
#07762:This gives you the rank of Dungeon Master.
#07768:This gives you the rank of Super Cheater.
#07774:This gives you the rank of Master Cheater.
#07780:This gives you the rank of Advanced Cheater.
#07786:You are in the Tomb of the Unknown Implementer.  A hollow voice
      :says, "That's not a bug, it's a feature!"
      :In the north wall of the room is the Crypt of the Implementers.  It
      :is made of the finest marble and is apparently large enough for four
      :headless corpses.  The crypt is #.  Above the entrance is the
      :cryptic inscription:
      :
      :		"Feel Free".
#07829:The door of the crypt is extremely heavy, but it opens easily.
#07837:The crypt is already open.
#07841:The crypt is already closed.
#07845:The crypt is closed.
#07848:The dial spins and comes to a stop pointing at "#".
#07855:There is no answer.
#07858:No one seems to be listening.
#07862:The dungeon master says, "Excellent."
#07867:The dungeon master says, "You are wrong.  You have four more chances."
#07876:The dungeon master says, "You are wrong.  You have three more chances."
#07885:The dungeon master says, "You are wrong.  You have two more chances."
#07894:The dungeon master says, "You are wrong.  You have one more chance."
#07903:The mirror is closed.
#07906:You must specify what to set the dial to.
#07912:The dial face contains only numbers.
#07917:The dial now points to "#".
#07921:The button depresses with a slight click and pops back.
#07928:The cell door is now closed.
#07932:You notice that the dungeon master does not follow.
#07939:The dungeon master catches up with you.
#07944:The dungeon master follows you.
#07948:There is a wooden wall blocking your way.
#07954:There is a large mirror blocking your way.
#07960:There is a large broken mirror blocking your way.
#07967:The structure blocks your way.
#07971:As you leave, the door swings shut.
#07976:You are in a narrow room whose west wall is a large mirror.
#07984:You are in a narrow room whose east wall is a large mirror.
#07992:You are in a narrow room whose west wall is a large wooden panel
      :which once contained a mirror.
#08004:You are in a narrow room whose east wall is a large wooden panel
      :which once contained a mirror.
#08016:The mirror is mounted on a panel which has been opened outward.
#08024:The panel has been opened outward.
#08029:The opposite wall is solid rock.
#08034:The dungeon master says, "You are wrong."  The dungeon master,
      :obviously disappointed in your lack of knowledge, shakes his head
      :and mumbles, "I guess they'll let anyone in the dungeon these days."
      :With that, he departs.
#08062:The dungeon master, obviously pleased, says, "You are indeed a
      :master of lore.  I am proud to be at your service."  The massive
      :wooden door swings open, and the master motions for you to enter.
#08087:Saves are not permitted during the endgame.
#08093:Restores are not permitted during the endgame.
#08099:The structure rotates clockwise.
#08104:The structure rotates counterclockwise.
#08109:I can't see a mirror here.
#08113:I don't see any way to open the mirror here.
#08119:The mirror breaks, revealing a panel behind it.
#08125:The mirror has already been broken.
#08130:The mirror is mounted on a wooden panel which moves slightly inward
      :as you push and back out as you let go.  The mirror feels rather
      :fragile.
#08148:The mirror is unyielding but seems rather fragile.
#08155:I can't see a panel here.
#08159:I don't see any way to open the panel here.
#08165:To break the panel you would have to break the mirror first.
#08173:The panel is not that easily destroyed.
#08178:The wooden panel moves slightly inward as you push and back out
      :when you let go.
#08189:The panel is unyielding.
#08193:A disheveled adventurer stares back at you.
#08199:The mirror is broken into little pieces.
#08205:Shards of a broken mirror are dangerous to play with.
#08212:The # side of the room is divided by a wooden wall into small
#08220:hallways to the #east and #west.
#08225:A large mirror fills the # side of the hallway.
#08231:A large panel fills the # side of the hallway.
#08237:The shattered pieces of a mirror cover the floor.
#08244:The corridor continues north.
#08248:The corridor continues south.
#08252:The corridor continues north and south.
#08257:Incantations are useless once you have gotten this far.
#08264:That incantation seems to have been a failure.
#08270:Sorry, only one incantation to a customer.
#08276:That spell has no obvious effect.
#08281:As the last syllable of your spell fades into silence, darkness
      :envelops you, and the earth shakes.  Then all is quiet.
#08296:The structure won't budge.
#08300:You are in a room with an exit to the north and a steel door to the east.
#08310:You are in a room with an exit to the north and a passage to the east.
#08319:The card slides easily into the slot and vanishes, and the steel
      :door slides open, revealing a passageway to the west.  A moment
      :later, a previously unseen sign flashes:
      :	"Unauthorized/Illegal Use of Pass Card -- Card Confiscated"
#08348:The item vanishes into the slot.  A moment later, a previously
      :unseen sign flashes "Garbage In, Garbage Out".  The #,
      :now atomized, spews through the slot.
#08368:I can't see any ladder here.
#08372:Come, come!
#08374:You hit your head on the ceiling and fall off the ladder.
#08382:You are in a small square room bounded to the north and west with
      :marble walls and to the east and south with sandstone walls.
#08398:It appears the thief was correct.
#08403:In the ceiling above you is a large circular opening.
#08410:The center of the floor is noticeably depressed here.
#08417:The west wall here has a large steel door at its center.  On one side
      :of the door is a small slit.

#09803:Reservoir South
#09805:Reservoir
#09807:Reservoir North

      :travels to the north and the east.
#09822:Stream View
#09824:You are on the gently flowing stream.  The upstream route is too narrow
      :to navigate, and the downstream route is invisible due to twisting
      :walls.  There is a narrow beach to land on.

      :flowing water below.
#09920:Deep Canyon
#09922:You are in a large room with a ceiling which cannot be detected from
      :the ground.  There is a narrow passage from east to west and a stone

      :heard faintly to the north.
#10051:Winding Passage
#10053:You are in a small chamber, which appears to have been part of a
      :coal mine.  On the south wall of the chamber the letters "GRANITE
      :WALL" are etched in the rock.  To the east is a long passage, and
      :there is a steep metal slide twisting downward.  From the appearance
      :of the slide, an attempt to climb up it would be impossible.  To the
      :north is a small opening.
#10099:Slide Room
#10101:You are standing at the entrance of what might have been a coal
      :mine.  To the northeast and the northwest are entrances to the mine,

#10229:You are in a small room which smells strongly of coal gas.
#10237:Gas Room

#10369:North-South Crawlway
#10372:You are on the west edge of a chasm, the bottom of which cannot be
      :seen.  The east side is sheer rock, providing no exits.  A narrow
      :passage goes west.  The path you are on continues to the north and south.
#10398:West of Chasm
#10400:Round Room
#10402:You are in a high north-south passage, which forks to the northeast.
#10411:North-South Passage

      :path exits to the south and to the east.
#10428:Chasm
#10429:You are in a cave.  Passages exit to the south and to the east, but
      :the cave narrows to a crack to the west.  The earth is particularly
      :damp here.
#10448:Damp Cave
#10450:A chasm, evidently produced by an ancient river, runs through the
      :cave here.  Passages lead off in all directions.
#10465:Ancient Chasm
#10467:You have entered a cave with passages leading north and southeast.
#10476:Engravings Cave
#10478:This is a room which is bare on all sides.  There is an exit down.

      :following words are written:  "No man shall enter this room without
      :solving this riddle--
      :	What is tall as a house,
      :	Round as a cup,
      :	And all the king's horses can't draw it up?".

#10528:Pearl Room
#10530:Entrance to Hades
#10533:Land of the Living Dead
#10536:You are standing in a small circular room with a pedestal.  A set of
      :stairs leads up, and passages leave the the east and west.
#10552:Grail Room
#10554:You are in the west end of a large temple.  On the south wall is an
      :ancient inscription, probably a prayer in a long-forgotten language.
      :The north wall is solid granite.  The entrance at the west end of the
      :room is through huge marble pillars.
#10585:Temple
#10586:You are in the east end of a large temple.  In front of you is what
      :appears to be an altar.
#10598:Altar
#10599:Dam
#10600:This room appears to have been the waiting room for groups touring
      :the dam.  There are exits here to the north and east marked
      :"PRIVATE", though the doors are open, and an exit to the south.
#10624:Dam Lobby
#10626:You are in what appears to have been the maintenance room for flood
      :control dam #3, judging by the assortment of tool chests around the
      :room.  Apparently, this room has been ransacked recently, for most of
      :the valuable equipment is gone.  On the wall in front of you is a
      :panel of buttons, which are labelled in EBCDIC.  However, they are of
      :different colors:  blue, yellow, brown, and red.  The doors to this
      :room are in the west and south ends.
#10682:Maintenance Room
#10685:Cyclops Room
#10687:You are in a long passage.  To the south is one entrance.  On the
      :east there is an old wooden door with a large hole in it (about
      :cyclops sized).
#10706:Strange Passage
#10708:This is a large room, whose north wall is solid granite.  A number
      :of discarded bags, which crumble at your touch, are scattered about
      :on the floor.  There is an exit down and what appears to be a newly
      :created passage to the east.
#10737:Treasure Room
#10739:You are in what appears to have been an artist's studio.  The walls
      :and floors are splattered with paints of 69 different colors.
      :Strangely enough, nothing of value is hanging here.  At the north and
      :northwest of the room are open doors (also covered with paint).  An
      :extremely dark and narrow chimney leads up from a fireplace.  Although
      :you might be able to get up the chimney, it seems unlikely that you
      :could get back down.
#10793:Studio
#10794:You are in an art gallery.  Most of the paintings which were here
      :have been stolen by vandals with exceptional taste.  The vandals

#10817:Gallery
#10818:You are at the base of flood control dam #3, which looms above you
      :and to the north.   The Frigid River is flowing by here.  Across the
      :river are the white cliffs, which seem to form a giant wall stretching
      :from north to south along the east shore of the river as it winds its
      :way downstream.
#10855:Dam Base
#10857:You are on the Frigid River in the vicinity of the dam.  The river
      :flows quietly here.  There is a landing on the west shore.
#10873:Frigid River
#10875:The river turns a corner here making it impossible to see the
      :dam.  The white cliffs loom on the east bank, and large rocks
      :prevent landing on the west.
#10895:The river descends here into a valley.  There is a narrow beach on
      :the east below the cliffs, and there is some shore on the west which
      :may be suitable.  In the distance a faint rumbling can be heard.
#10921:You are on a narrow strip of beach which runs along the base of the
      :white cliffs.  The only path here is a narrow one, heading south
      :along the cliffs.
#10940:White Cliffs Beach
#10943:You are on a rocky, narrow strip of beach beside the cliffs.  A
      :narrow path leads north along the shore.
#10957:The river is running faster here, and the sound ahead appears to be
      :that of rushing water.  On the west shore is a sandy beach.  A small
      :area of beach can also be seen below the cliffs.
#10981:The sound of rushing water is nearly unbearable here.  On the west
      :shore is a large landing area.
#10994:Moby Lossage
#10996:You are on the shore of the river.  The river here seems somewhat
      :treacherous.  A path travels from north to south here, the south end
      :quickly turning around a sharp corner.
#11018:Shore
#11019:You are on a large sandy beach at the shore of the river, which is
      :flowing quickly by.  A path runs beside the river to the south here.
#11036:Sandy Beach
#11038:You are on the west shore of the river.  An entrance to a cave is
      :to the northwest.  The shore is very rocky here.
#11053:Rocky Shore
#11055:You are in a small cave whose exits are on the south and northwest.
#11064:Small Cave
#11066:You are in a barrel.  Congratulations.  Etched into the side of the
      :barrel is the word "GERONIMO!".
#11079:Barrel
#11080:Aragain Falls
#11082:You are on top of a rainbow (I bet you never thought you would walk
      :on a rainbow), with a magnificent view of the falls.  The rainbow
      :travels east-west here.
#11102:Rainbow room
#11104:You are on a small beach on the continuation of the Frigid River
      :past the falls.  The beach is narrow due to the presence of the white
      :cliffs.  The river canyon opens here, and sunlight shines in from
      :above.  A rainbow crosses over the falls to the west, and a narrow path
      :continues to the southeast.
#11142:End of rainbow
#11144:You are beneath the walls of the river canyon, which may be climbable
      :here.  There is a small stream here, which is the lesser part of the
      :runoff of Aragain Falls.  To the north is a narrow path.
#11169:Canyon Bottom
#11171:You are on a ledge about halfway up the wall of the river canyon.
      :You can see from here that the main flow from Aragain Falls twists
      :along a passage which it is impossible to enter.  Below you is the
      :canyon bottom.  Above you is more cliff, which still appears
      :climbable.
#11205:Rocky Ledge
#11207:You are at the top of the great canyon on its south wall. From here
      :there is a marvelous view of the canyon and parts of the Frigid River
      :upstream.  Across the canyon, the walls of the white cliffs still
      :appear to loom far above.  Following the canyon upstream (north and
      :northwest), Aragain Falls may be seen, complete with rainbow.
      :Fortunately, my vision is better than average, and I can discern the
      :top of flood control dam #3 far to the distant north.  To the
      :west and south can be seen an immense forest, stretching for miles
      :around.  It is possible to climb down into the canyon from here.
#11282:Canyon View
#11284:You are at the bottom of a large dormant volcano.  High above you
      :light may be seen entering from the cone of the volcano.  The only
      :exit here is to the north.
#11304:Volcano Bottom
#11306:You are about one hundred feet above the bottom of the volcano.  The
      :top of the volcano is clearly visible here.
#11321:Volcano Core
#11323:You are about two hundred feet above the volcano floor.  Looming
      :above is the rim of the volcano.  There is a small ledge on the
      :west side.
#11341:Volcano near small ledge
#11345:You are high above the floor of the volcano.  From here the rim of
      :the volcano looks very narrow, and you are quite near it.  To the
      :east is what appears to be a viewing ledge, too thin to land on.
#11370:Volcano near viewing ledge
#11374:You are near the rim of the volcano, which is only about fifteen feet
      :across.  To the west, there is a place to land with a wide ledge.
#11391:Volcano near wide ledge
#11394:You are on a narrow ledge overlooking the inside of an old dormant
      :volcano.  This ledge appears to be about in the middle between the
      :floor below and the rim above.  There is an exit here to the south.
#11420:Narrow Ledge
#11422:You are on a ledge in the middle of a large volcano.  Below you
      :the volcano bottom can be seen and above is the rim of the volcano.
      :A couple of ledges can be seen on the other side of the volcano;
      :it appears that this ledge is intermediate in elevation between
      :those on the other side.  The exit from this room is to the east.
#11463:Volcano View
#11465:Wide ledge
#11467:You are in a room which must have been a large library, probably
      :for the royal family.  All of the shelves appear to have been gnawed
      :to pieces by unfriendly gnomes.  To the north is an exit.
#11491:Library
#11492:Dusty Room
#11494:You are in a small room, whose walls are formed by an old lava flow.
      :There are exits here to the west and the south.
#11509:Lava Room
#11511:Tomb of the Unknown Implementer
#11515:Low Room
#11517:You are in a large room full of assorted heavy machinery.  The room
      :smells of burned resistors.  The room is noisy from the whirring
      :sounds of the machines.  Along one wall of the room are three buttons
      :which are, respectively, round, triangular, and square.  Naturally,
      :above the buttons are instructions written in EBCDIC.  A large sign
      :above all the buttons says in English:
      :
      :		    DANGER:  HIGH VOLTAGE
      :
      :There are exits to the west and the south.
#11574:You are in a dingy closet adjacent to the machine room.  On one wall
      :is a small sticker which reads:
      :
      :		Protected by
      :		  FROBOZZ
      :	     Magic Alarm Company
      :	      (Hello, footpad!).
#11597:Dingy Closet
#11599:You are trapped inside an steel cage.
#11604:Cage
#11605:You are at the top of the well.  Well done.  There are etchings on
      :the side of the well.  There is a small crack across the floor at the
      :entrance to a room on the east, but it can be crossed easily.
#11630:Top of Well
#11632:You are in a damp circular room, whose walls are made of brick and
      :mortar.  The roof of this room is not visible, but there appear to be
      :some etchings on the walls.  There is a passageway to the west.
#11658:Bottom of Well
#11660:You are in a small square room, in the center of which is a large
      :oblong table, no doubt set for afternoon tea.  It is clear from the
      :objects on the table that the users were indeed mad.  In the eastern
      :corner of this room is a small hole no more than four inches high.
      :There are passageways leading away to the west and the northwest.
#11702:Tea Room
#11704:You are in an enormous room, in the center of which are four wooden
      :posts delineating a rectangular area, above which is what appears to
      :be a wooden roof.  In fact, all objects in this room appear to be
      :abnormally large.  To the east is a passageway.  There is a large
      :chasm on the west and the northwest.
#11743:Posts Room
#11745:You are in a large room, one half of which is depressed.  There is a
      :large leak in the ceiling through which brown colored goop is
      :falling.  The only exit from this room is to the west.
#11769:Pool Room
#11771:Up a Tree
#11773:You are in the large entrance hall of the Bank of Zork, the largest
      :banking institution of the Great Underground Empire.  A partial
      :account of its history is in "The Lives of the Twelve Flatheads" with
      :the chapter on J. Pierpont Flathead.  A more detailed history (albeit
      :less objective) may be found in Flathead's outrageous autobiography
      :"I'm Rich and You Aren't - So There!".
      :Most of the furniture has been ravaged by passing scavengers.  All
      :that remains are two signs at the northwest and northeast corners of
      :the room, which say
      :
      :	<-- WEST VIEWING ROOM		EAST VIEWING ROOM -->
#11846:Bank Entrance
#11848:You are in a small square room, which was used by a bank officer
      :whose job it was to retrieve safety deposit boxes for the customer.
      :On the north side of the room is a sign which reads "Viewing Room".

      :their contents.  On the north side of the room is a sign which says
      :
      :   REMAIN HERE WHILE THE BANK OFFICER RETRIEVES YOUR DEPOSIT BOX
      :    WHEN YOU ARE FINISHED, LEAVE THE BOX, AND EXIT TO THE SOUTH
      :     AN ADVANCED PROTECTIVE DEVICE PREVENTS ALL CUSTOMERS FROM
      :      REMOVING ANY SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX FROM THIS VIEWING AREA!
      :               Thank you for banking at the Zork!
#11983:Viewing Room
#11985:You are in a small bare room with no distinguishing features.  There
      :are no exits from this room.
#11998:Small Room
#12000:You are in the Vault of the Bank of Zork, in which there are no doors.
#12009:Vault
#12010:You are in a large rectangular room.  The east and west walls here
      :were used for storing safety deposit boxes.  As might be expected,
      :all have been carefully removed by evil persons.  To the east, west,
      :and south of the room are large doorways.  The northern "wall"
      :of the room is a shimmering curtain of light.  In the center of the
      :room is a large stone cube, about 10 feet on a side.  Engraved on
      :the side of the cube is some lettering.
#12065:Safety Depository
#12068:This room was the office of the Chairman of the Bank of Zork.
      :Like the other rooms here, it has been extensively vandalized.
      :The lone exit is to the north.
#12088:Chairman's Office
#12091:Crypt
#12092:You are standing at the top of a flight of stairs that lead down to
      :a passage below.  Dim light, as from torches, can be seen in the
      :passage.  Behind you the stairs lead into untouched rock.
#12116:Top of Stairs
#12118:You are standing near one end of a long dimly lit hall.  To the
      :south, stone stairs ascend.  To the north, the corridor is illum-
      :inated by torches set high in the wall, out of reach.  On one wall
      :is a red button.

      :in a style that bespeaks exquisite taste.  To judge from its
      :contents, it is the ultimate storehouse of the treasures of Zork.
      :   There are chests here containing precious jewels, mountains of
      :zorkmids, rare paintings, ancient statuary, and beguiling curios.
      :   In one corner of the room is a bookcase boasting such volumes
      :as "The History of the Great Underground Empire", "The Lives of
      :the Twelve Flatheads", "The Wisdom of the Implementers", and
      :other informative and inspiring works.
      :   On one wall is a completely annotated map of the Dungeon of
      :Zork, showing points of interest and various troves of treasure,
      :and indicating the locations of several superior scenic views.

      :
      :  Flood control dam #3 (FCD #3) was constructed in year 783 of the
      :Great Underground Empire to harness the destructive power of the
      :Frigid River.  This work was supported by a grant of 37 million
      :zorkmids from the central bureaucracy and your own omnipotent local
      :tyrant Lord Dimwit Flathead the Excessive.  This impressive structure
      :is composed of 3.7 cubic feet of concrete, is 256 feet tall at the
      :center, and 193 feet wide at the top.  The reservoir created behind
      :the dam has a volume of 37 billion cubic feet, an area of 12 million
      :square feet, and a shore line of 36 thousand feet.
      :
      :  The construction of FCD #3 took 112 days from ground breaking to
      :the dedication.  It required a work force of 384 slaves, 34 slave
      :drivers, 12 engineers, 2 turtle doves, and a partridge in a pear
      :tree.  The work was managed by a command team composed of 234
      :bureaucrats, 2347 secretaries (at least two of whom could type),
      :12,256 paper shufflers, 52,469 rubber stampers, 245,193 red tape
      :processors, and nearly one million dead trees.

      :
      :This version of Dungeon for the PDP-11/VAX-11 has been completely
      :reimplemented in FORTRAN-IV from the original MDL sources created
      :at MIT.  The parser in this version is somewhat simpler than the
      :parser in the ARPAnet version;  within this limit, this version
      :is fully congruent with the current version on the ARPAnet.
      :
      :This version has been converted from FORTRAN-IV to C via f77.  If
      :you have any problems, please report them to:

      :Mr. TAA of Muddle, Mass. says:  "Before I took this course I used

      :future and make really big Zorkmids."

#13307:		    Welcome to Dungeon!
      :
      :   Dungeon is a game of adventure, danger, and low cunning.  In it
      :you will explore some of the most amazing territory ever seen by mortal
      :man.  Hardened adventurers have run screaming from the terrors contained
      :within.
      :
      :   In Dungeon, the intrepid explorer delves into the forgotten secrets
      :of a lost labyrinth deep in the bowels of the earth, searching for
      :vast treasures long hidden from prying eyes, treasures guarded by
      :fearsome monsters and diabolical traps!
      :
      :   No DECsystem should be without one!
      :
      :   Dungeon was created at the Programming Technology Division of the MIT
      :Laboratory for Computer Science by Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce
      :Daniels, and Dave Lebling.  It was inspired by the Adventure game of
      :Crowther and Woods, and the Dungeons and Dragons game of Gygax
