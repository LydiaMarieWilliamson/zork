[63]:	│Useful commands:
	│
	│   The 'BRIEF' command suppresses printing of long room descriptions
	│for rooms which have been visited.  The 'SUPERBRIEF' command suppresses
	│printing of long room descriptions for all rooms.  The 'VERBOSE'
	│command restores long descriptions.
	│   The 'INFO' command prints information which might give some idea
	│of what the game is about.
	│   The 'QUIT' command prints your score and asks whether you wish
	│to continue playing.
	│   The 'SAVE' command saves the state of the game for later continuation.
	│   The 'RESTORE' command restores a saved game.
	│   The 'INVENTORY' command lists the objects in your possession.
	│   The 'LOOK' command prints a description of your surroundings.
	│   The 'SCORE' command prints your current score and ranking.
	│   The 'TIME' command tells you how long you have been playing.
	│   The 'DIAGNOSE' command reports on your injuries, if any.
	│
	│Command abbreviations:
	│
	│   The 'INVENTORY' command may be abbreviated 'I'.
	│   The 'LOOK' command may be abbreviated 'L'.
	│   The 'QUIT' command may be abbreviated 'Q'.
	│
	│Containment:
	│
	│   Some objects can contain other objects.  Many such containers can
	│be opened and closed.  The rest are always open.   They may or may
	│not be transparent.  For you to access (e.g., take) an object
	│which is in a container, the container must be open.  For you
	│to see such an object, the container must be either open or
	│transparent.  Containers have a capacity, and objects have sizes;
	│the number of objects which will fit therefore depends on their
	│sizes.  You may put any object you have access to (it need not be
	│in your hands) into any other object.  At some point, the program
	│will attempt to pick it up if you don't already have it, which
	│process may fail if you're carrying too much.  Although containers
	│can contain other containers, the program doesn't access more than
	│one level down.
	│
	│Fighting:
	│
	│   Occupants of the dungeon will, as a rule, fight back when
	│attacked.  In some cases, they may attack even if unprovoked.
	│Useful verbs here are 'ATTACK <villain> WITH <weapon>', 'KILL',
	│etc.  Knife-throwing may or may not be useful.  You have a
	│fighting strength which varies with time.  Being in a fight,
	│getting killed, and being injured all lower this strength.
	│Strength is regained with time.  Thus, it is not a good idea to
	│fight someone immediately after being killed.  Other details
	│should become apparent after a few melees or deaths.
	│
	│Command parser:
	│
	│   A command is one line of text terminated by a carriage return.
	│For reasons of simplicity, all words are distinguished by their
	│first six letters.  All others are ignored.  For example, typing
	│'DISASSEMBLE THE ENCYCLOPEDIA' is not only meaningless, it also
	│creates excess effort for your fingers.  Note that this trunca-
	│tion may produce ambiguities in the intepretation of longer words.
	│
	│   You are dealing with a fairly stupid parser, which understands
	│the following types of things--
	│
	│   Actions:
	│	Among the more obvious of these, such as TAKE, PUT, DROP, etc.
	│	Fairly general forms of these may be used, such as PICK UP,
	│	PUT DOWN, etc.
	│
	│   Directions:
	│	NORTH, SOUTH, UP, DOWN, etc. and their various abbreviations.
	│	Other more obscure directions (LAND, CROSS) are appropriate in
	│	only certain situations.
	│
	│   Objects:
	│	Most objects have names and can be referenced by them.
	│
	│   Adjectives:
	│	Some adjectives are understood and required when there are
	│	two objects which can be referenced with the same 'name' (e.g.,
	│	DOORs, BUTTONs).
	│
	│   Prepositions:
	│	It may be necessary in some cases to include prepositions, but
	│	the parser attempts to handle cases which aren't ambiguous
	│	without.  Thus 'GIVE CAR TO DEMON' will work, as will 'GIVE DEMON
	│	CAR'.  'GIVE CAR DEMON' probably won't do anything interesting.
	│	When a preposition is used, it should be appropriate;  'GIVE CAR
	│	WITH DEMON' won't parse.
	│
	│   Sentences:
	│	The parser understands a reasonable number of syntactic construc-
	│	tions.  In particular, multiple commands (separated by commas)
	│	can be placed on the same line.
	│
	│   Ambiguity:
	│	The parser tries to be clever about what to do in the case of
	│	actions which require objects that are not explicitly specified.
	│	If there is only one possible object, the parser will assume
	│	that it should be used.  Otherwise, the parser will ask.
	│	Most questions asked by the parser can be answered.
[605]:	│Welcome to Dungeon!
	│
	│   You are near a large dungeon, which is reputed to contain vast
	│quantities of treasure.   Naturally, you wish to acquire some of it.
	│In order to do so, you must of course remove it from the dungeon.  To
	│receive full credit for it, you must deposit it safely in the trophy
	│case in the living room of the house.
	│
	│   In addition to valuables, the dungeon contains various objects
	│which may or may not be useful in your attempt to get rich.  You may
	│need sources of light, since dungeons are often dark, and weapons,
	│since dungeons often have unfriendly things wandering about.  Reading
	│material is scattered around the dungeon as well;  some of it
	│is rumored to be useful.
	│
	│   To determine how successful you have been, a score is kept.
	│When you find a valuable object and pick it up, you receive a
	│certain number of points, which depends on the difficulty of finding
	│the object.  You receive extra points for transporting the treasure
	│safely to the living room and placing it in the trophy case.  In
	│addition, some particularly interesting rooms have a value associated
	│with visiting them.  The only penalty is for getting yourself killed,
	│which you may do only twice.
	│
	│   Of special note is a thief (always carrying a large bag) who
	│likes to wander around in the dungeon (he has never been seen by the
	│light of day).  He likes to take things.  Since he steals for pleasure
	│rather than profit and is somewhat sadistic, he only takes things which
	│you have seen.  Although he prefers valuables, sometimes in his haste
	│he may take something which is worthless.  From time to time, he examines
	│his take and discards objects which he doesn't like.  He may occas-
	│ionally stop in a room you are visiting, but more often he just wanders
	│through and rips you off (he is a skilled pickpocket).
[831]:	│Please answer the question.
[835]:	│You clearly are a suicidal maniac.  We don't allow psychotics in the
	│dungeon, since they may harm other adventurers.  Your remains will be
	│installed in the land of the living dead, where your fellow adventurers
	│may gloat over them.
[864]:	│What?  You don't trust me?  Why, only last week I patched a running
	│RSX system and it survived for over thirty seconds.  Oh, well.
[881]:	│Now let me see...
	│Well, we weren't quite able to restore your state.  You can't have
	│everything.
[894]:	│Do you wish me to try to patch you?
[899]:	│You are behind the white house.  In one corner of the house
	│there is a window which is #.
[911]:	│open
[912]:	│slightly ajar
[914]:	│You are in the kitchen of the white house.  A table seems to have
	│been used recently for the preparation of food.  A passage leads to
	│the west, and a dark staircase can be seen leading upward.  To the
	│east is a small window which is #.
[944]:	│You are in the living room.  There is a door to the east.  To the west
	│is a wooden door with strange gothic lettering, which appears to be
	│nailed shut.
[963]:	│You are in the living room.  There is a door to the east.  To the west
	│is a cyclops-shaped hole in an old wooden door, above which is some
	│strange gothic lettering.
[984]:	│In the center of the room is a large oriental rug.
[991]:	│In the center of the room is a closed trap door.
[998]:	│In the center of the room is an open trap door.
[1004]:	│There is a rug lying next to an open trap door.
[1010]:	│You are in a dark and damp cellar with a narrow passageway leading
	│east, and a crawlway to the south.  To the west is the bottom of a
	│steep metal ramp which is unclimbable.
[1032]:	│The door crashes shut, and you hear someone barring it.
[1039]:	│You are in a small room near the maze.  There are twisty
	│passages in the immediate vicinity.
[1051]:	│Above you is a grating locked with a skull-and-crossbones lock.
[1059]:	│Above you is an open grating with sunlight pouring in.
[1066]:	│Above you is a grating.
[1069]:	│You are in a clearing, with a forest surrounding you on the west
	│and south.
[1079]:	│There is a grating securely fastened into the ground.
[1086]:	│There is an open grating descending into darkness.
[1093]:	│A grating appears on the ground.
[1098]:	│You are in a long room on the south shore of a large reservoir.
[1106]:	│You are in a long room, to the north of which was formerly a
	│reservoir.  However, with the water level lowered, there is merely
	│a wide stream running through the center of the room.
[1129]:	│There is a western exit, a passageway south, and a steep pathway
	│climbing up along the edge of a cliff.
[1142]:	│You are on the reservoir.  Beaches can be seen north and south.
	│Upstream a small stream enters the reservoir through a narrow
	│cleft in the rocks.  The dam can be seen downstream.
[1165]:	│You are on what used to be a large reservoir, but which is now a
	│large mud pile.  There are 'shores' to the north and south.
[1181]:	│You are in a large cavernous room, north of a large reservoir.
[1189]:	│You are in a large cavernous room, to the south of which was formerly
	│a reservoir.  However, with the water level lowered, there is merely
	│a wide stream running through the center of the room.
[1214]:	│There is a tunnel leaving the room to the north.
[1221]:	│You are in a large room with giant icicles hanging from the walls
	│and ceiling.  There are passages to the north and east.
[1237]:	│Part of the glacier has been melted.
[1242]:	│There is a large passageway leading westward.
[1248]:	│You are in a large square room with tall ceilings.  There are exits
	│on the north, east, and west sides of the room.  On the south wall is
	│an enormous mirror which fills the entire wall.
[1272]:	│Unfortunately, you have managed to destroy it by your reckless
	│actions.
[1281]:	│		BOOOOOOOOOM
[1283]:	│You are in large room which seems to be air conditioned.  In one
	│corner there is a machine (?) which is shaped somewhat like a clothes
	│dryer.  On the 'panel' there is a switch which is labelled in an
	│obscure dialect of Swahili.  Fortunately, I know this dialect, and the
	│label translates to 'START'.  The switch does not appear to be manip-
	│ulable by any human hand (unless the fingers are about 1/16 by 1/4
	│inch).  On the front of the machine is a large lid, which is #.
[1342]:	│closed
[1343]:	│The cave is very windy at the moment, and your candles have blown out.
[1352]:	│You are in a small room that has only one door, to the east.
[1360]:	│In the corner of the room on the ceiling is a large vampire bat who
	│is obviously deranged and holding his nose.
[1374]:	│A deranged vampire bat (a reject from WUMPUS) swoops down
	│from the ceiling and lifts you away...
[1387]:	│You are at the periphery of a large dome, which forms the ceiling
	│of another room below.  Protecting you from a precipitous drop is a
	│wooden railing which circles the dome.
[1409]:	│Hanging down from the railing is a rope which ends about ten feet
	│from the floor below.
[1420]:	│I'm afraid that the leap you attempted has done you in.
[1427]:	│You are in a large room with a prominent doorway leading to a down
	│staircase.  To the west is a narrow twisting tunnel.  Above you is a
	│large dome painted with scenes depicting elvish hacking rites.  Up
	│around the edge of the dome (20 feet up) is a wooden railing.  In the
	│center of the room there is a white marble pedestal.
[1468]:	│A large piece of rope descends from the railing above, ending some
	│five feet above your head.
[1480]:	│You are in a circular room with passages off in eight directions.
[1489]:	│Your compass needle spins wildly, and you cannot get your bearings.
[1498]:	│According to Prof. TAA of MIT Tech, the rapidly changing magnetic
	│fields in the room are so intense as to cause you to be electrocuted.
	│I really don't know, but in any event, something has killed you.
[1524]:	│You are outside a large gateway, on which is inscribed:
	│
	│	"Abandon every hope, all ye who enter here."
	│
	│The gate is open.  Through it you can see a desolation, with a pile of
	│mangled corpses in one corner.  Thousands of voices, lamenting some
	│hideous fate, can be heard.
[1558]:	│The way through the gate is barred by evil spirits, who jeer at your
	│attempts to pass.
[1569]:	│There is a clap of thunder, and a voice echoes through the
	│cavern:  "Begone, chomper!"  Apparently, the voice thinks you
	│are an evil spirit and dismisses you from the land of the living.
[1593]:	│You are not equipped for an exorcism.
[1598]:	│There is a clap of thunder, and a voice echoes through the
	│cavern:  "Begone, fiends!"  The spirits, sensing the presense
	│of a greater power, flee through the walls.
[1619]:	│You have entered the land of the living dead, a large desolate
	│room.  Although it is apparently uninhabited, you can hear the
	│sounds of thousands of lost souls weeping and moaning.  In
	│the east corner are stacked the remains of dozens of previous
	│adventurers who were less fortunate than yourself.  To the east
	│is an ornate passage, apparently recently constructed.
[1665]:	│Amid the desolation, you spot what appears to be your head,
	│tastefully impaled on the end of a long pole.
[1679]:	│You are standing on the top of flood control dam #3, which was
	│quite a tourist attraction in times far distant.  There are paths
	│to the north, south, east, and down.
[1700]:	│The sluice gates on the dam are closed.  Behind the dam, there can
	│be seen a wide lake.  A small stream is formed by the runoff from
	│the lake.
[1718]:	│It appears that the dam has been opened, since the water level behind
	│the dam is low and the sluice gate is open.  Water is rushing down-
	│stream through the gates.
[1739]:	│There is a control panel here.  There is a large metal bolt on the
	│panel.  Above the bolt is a small green plastic bubble.
[1755]:	│The green bubble is glowing.
[1759]:	│The water level is now up to your ankles.
[1765]:	│The water level is now up to your shins.
[1771]:	│The water level is now up to your knees.
[1777]:	│The water level is now up to your hips.
[1782]:	│The water level is now up to your waist.
[1788]:	│The water level is now up to your chest.
[1794]:	│The water level is now up to your neck.
[1799]:	│The water level is now over your head.
[1804]:	│The water level is now high in your lungs.
[1810]:	│The room is full of water and cannot be entered.
[1817]:	│I'm afraid you have done drowned yourself.
[1823]:	│You hear a scream of anguish as you violate the robber's hideaway.
	│Using passages unknown to you, he rushes to its defense.
[1839]:	│The thief gestures mysteriously, and the treasures in the room
	│suddenly vanish.
[1849]:	│Something seems funny about the feel of the buoy.
[1856]:	│Oh dear, you seem to have gone over Aragain Falls.  Not a very
	│smart thing to do, apparently.
[1868]:	│You seem to be digging a hole here.
[1873]:	│The hole is getting deeper, but that's about it.
[1880]:	│You are surrounded by a wall of sand on all sides.
[1887]:	│You can see a small statue in the sand.
[1892]:	│The wall collapses, smothering you.
[1897]:	│There is nothing to dig into here.
[1902]:	│You are digging into a pile of bat guano.
[1908]:	│You seem to be getting knee deep in guano.
[1914]:	│You are covered with bat turds, cretin.
[1919]:	│This is getting you nowhere.
[1923]:	│You are at the top of Aragain Falls, an enormous waterfall with a
	│drop of about 450 feet.  The only path here is on the north end.
	│There is a man-sized barrel here which you could fit into.
[1947]:	│A beautiful rainbow can be seen over the falls and to the east.
[1955]:	│A solid rainbow spans the falls.
[1960]:	│According to Prof. TAA of MIT Tech, the rapidly changing magnetic
	│fields in the room are so intense as to fry all the delicate innards
	│of the robot.  I really don't know, but in any event, smoke is coming
	│out of its ears, and it has stopped moving.
[1992]:	│You are on a wide ledge high into the volcano.  The rim of the
	│volcano is about 200 feet above, and there is a precipitous drop
	│below to the floor.
[2011]:	│The way to the south is blocked by rubble.
[2017]:	│There is a small door to the south.
[2022]:	│You are in a dusty old room which is virtually featureless, except
	│for an exit on the north side.
[2035]:	│Imbedded in the far wall is a rusty old box.  It appears that
	│the box is somewhat damaged, since an oblong hole has been
	│chipped out of the front of it.
[2055]:	│On the far wall is a rusty box, whose door has been blown off.
[2063]:	│You are in a room with a low ceiling which is circular in shape.
	│There are exits to the east and southeast.
[2077]:	│As you enter, your compass starts spinning wildly.
[2084]:	│The ledge has collapsed and cannot be landed on.
[2091]:	│The ledge collapses, giving you a narrow escape.
[2098]:	│The force of the explosion has caused the ledge to collapse belatedly.
[2107]:	│The ledge collapses, leaving you with no place to land.
[2114]:	│The ledge collapses, probably as a result of the explosion.  A large
	│chunk of it, which is attached to the hook, drags you down to the
	│ground.  Fatally.
[2134]:	│The way is blocked by debris from an explosion.
[2140]:	│You may recall your recent explosion.  Well, probably as a result of
	│that, you hear an ominous rumbling, as if one of the rooms in the
	│dungeon has collapsed.
[2160]:	│The room trembles and 50,000 pounds of rock fall on you,
	│turning you into a pancake.
[2171]:	│The house shakes, and the ceiling of the room you're in collapses,
	│turning you into a pancake.
[2183]:	│A volcano gnome seems to walk straight out of the wall and says,
	│"I have a very busy appointment schedule and little time to waste on
	│trespassers, but for a very small fee, I'll show you the way out."
	│You notice that the gnome is nervously glancing at his watch.
[2216]:	│Suddenly a sinister, wraithlike figure, cloaked and hooded, appears
	│seeming to float in the air before you.  In a low, almost inaudible
	│voice he says, "I welcome you to the ranks of the chosen of Zork.  You
	│have persisted through many trials and tests and have overcome them
	│all.  One such as yourself is fit to join even the implementers!"
	│He then raises his oaken staff and, chuckling, drifts away like a
	│wisp of smoke, his laughter fading in the distance.

	│   Attention:  Dungeon Maintenance
[2292]:	│Unfortunately, it is impossible to tell directions in here.
[2300]:	│The slag turns out to be rather insubstantial and crumbles into dust
	│at your touch.  It must not have been very valuable.
[2316]:	│The lid opens.
[2318]:	│The lid closes.
[2320]:	│Look around.
[2322]:	│You think it isn't?
[2325]:	│I think you've already done that.
[2330]:	│The trophy case is securely fastened to the wall (perhaps to foil any
	│attempt by robbers to remove it).
[2343]:	│The bottle hits the far wall and is decimated.
[2349]:	│The basket is at the other end of the chain.
[2355]:	│A brilliant maneuver destroys the bottle.
[2361]:	│The water splashes on the walls and evaporates immediately.
[2369]:	│The water spills to the floor and evaporates immediately.
[2377]:	│It is not tied to anything.
[2381]:	│There is nothing it can be tied to.
[2386]:	│The rope is already attached.
[2390]:	│The rope drops over the side and comes within ten feet of the floor.
[2399]:	│I see no objects here.
[2402]:	│Although you tied it incorrectly, the rope becomes free.
[2410]:	│The rope drops gently to the floor below.
[2416]:	│The rope is tied to the railing.
[2421]:	│The lamp has smashed into the floor, and the light has gone out.
[2430]:	│The rug is too heavy to lift, but in trying to raise it you
	│notice an irregularity beneath it.
[2442]:	│The rug is extremely heavy and cannot be carried.
[2449]:	│With a great effort, the rug is moved to one side of the room.
	│With the rug moved, the dusty cover of a closed trap door appears.
[2466]:	│Having moved the carpet previously, you find it impossible
	│to move it again.
[2476]:	│You are stopped by a cloud of poisonous gas.
[2482]:	│Time passes... and you die from some obscure poisoning.
[2489]:	│The gnome glances at his watch.  "Oops!  I'm late for an
	│an appointment."  He disappears, leaving you alone on the shelf.
[2505]:	│Now you've done it.  It seems that the brick has other properties
	│than weight, namely the ability to blow you to smithereens.
[2521]:	│There is an explosion nearby.
[2525]:	│The wire rapidly burns into nothing.
[2530]:	│The match has gone out.
[2533]:	│The lamp appears to be getting dimmer.
[2538]:	│The lamp is dying.
[2541]:	│The candles grow short.
[2544]:	│The candles are very short.
[2548]:	│The leaves burn, and the neighbors start to complain.
[2555]:	│The sight of someone carrying a pile of burning leaves so offends
	│the neighbors that they come over and put you out.
[2570]:	│As you pick up the rusty knife, your sword gives a single pulse
	│of blinding blue light.
[2581]:	│As the knife approaches its victim, your mind is submerged by an
	│overmastering will.  Slowly, your hand turns, until the rusty blade
	│is an inch from your neck.  The knife seems almost to sing as it
	│savagely cuts your throat.
[2610]:	│A ghost appears in the room and is appalled by your desecration
	│of the remains of a fellow adventurer.  He casts a curse on
	│all of your valuables and orders them banished to the land of
	│the living dead.  The ghost leaves, muttering obscenities.
[2641]:	│There is a rumble from deep within the earth, and the room shakes.
[2650]:	│There is an ugly person staring at you.
[2655]:	│The mirror is broken into many pieces.
[2660]:	│Nobody but a greedy surgeon would allow you to attempt that trick.
[2669]:	│You have broken the mirror.  I hope you have a seven years supply of
	│good luck available.
[2681]:	│Haven't you done enough already?
[2686]:	│The torch hits the glacier and explodes into a great ball of flame,
	│devouring the glacier.  The water from the melting glacier rushes
	│downstream, carrying the torch with it.  In place of the glacier,
	│there is a passageway leading west.
[2716]:	│The melting glacier seems to have carried the torch away, leaving
	│you in the dark.
[2727]:	│The glacier is unmoved by your ridiculous attempt.
[2734]:	│Part of the glacier melts, drowning you under a torrent of water.
[2743]:	│burned out ivory torch
[2746]:	│There is a burned out ivory torch here.
[2751]:	│The basket is raised to the top of the shaft.
[2757]:	│The basket is lowered to the bottom of the shaft.
[2764]:	│The cage is securely fastened to the iron chain.
[2771]:	│You seem unable to affect these spirits.
[2777]:	│How can you attack a spirit with material objects?
[2784]:	│The book is open to page 569.
[2788]:	│As hard as you try, the book cannot be closed.
[2794]:	│A booming voice says, "Wrong, cretin!", and you notice that you
	│have turned into a pile of dust.
[2807]:	│I'm afraid that you have run out of matches.
[2813]:	│One of the matches starts to burn.
[2818]:	│The match is out.
[2821]:	│The tube refuses to accept anything.
[2826]:	│The cyclops yawns and stares at the thing that woke him.
[2834]:	│The cyclops, tired of all your games and trickery, eats you.
	│The cyclops says, "Mmm mmm!  Just like mom used to make 'em."
[2850]:	│The cyclops says, "Mmm mmm!  I love hot peppers!  But oh, could I use
	│a drink.  Perhaps I could drink the blood of that thing."  From the
	│gleam in his eye, it could be surmised that you are 'that thing'.
[2876]:	│The cyclops looks tired and quickly falls fast asleep (what did you
	│put in that drink, anyway?).
[2889]:	│The cyclops is apparently not thirsty at the moment and refuses
	│your generous gesture.
[2900]:	│The cyclops may be hungry, but there is a limit.
[2907]:	│The cyclops is not so stupid as to eat that!
[2913]:	│The cyclops seems somewhat agitated.
[2918]:	│The cyclops appears to be getting more agitated.
[2925]:	│The cyclops is moving about the room, looking for something.
[2933]:	│The cyclops was looking for salt and pepper.  I think he is gathering
	│condiments for his upcoming snack.
[2947]:	│The cyclops is moving toward you in an unfriendly manner.
[2955]:	│You have two choices:  1. Leave  2. Become dinner.
[2962]:	│Your actions don't appear to be doing much harm to the cyclops, but
	│they do not exactly lower your insurance premiums, either.
[2978]:	│The cyclops ignores all injuries to his body with a shrug.
[2986]:	│The cyclops is rather heavy and doesn't take kindly to being grabbed.
[2995]:	│You cannot tie the cyclops, although he is fit to be tied.
[3003]:	│Realizing just in time that you'd be stabbed in the back if you
	│tried to take the chalice, you return to the fray.
[3018]:	│Congratulations!  Unlike the other vandals, who merely stole the
	│artist's masterpieces, you have destroyed one.
[3032]:	│worthless piece of canvas
[3036]:	│There is a worthless piece of canvas here.
[3042]:	│With great effort, you open the window far enough to allow passage.
[3051]:	│The window closes (more easily than it opened).
[3057]:	│The bolt won't turn with your best effort.
[3063]:	│The sluice gates open, and water pours through the dam.
[3070]:	│The sluice gates close, and water starts to collect behind the dam.
[3079]:	│You can't do that!
[3082]:	│The grating is locked.
[3085]:	│The grating opens to reveal trees above you.
[3091]:	│The grating opens.
[3094]:	│The grating is unlocked.
[3098]:	│The door reluctantly opens to reveal a rickety staircase descending
	│into darkness.
[3109]:	│The door swings shut and closes.
[3114]:	│The door is locked from above.
[3118]:	│The door cannot be opened.
[3122]:	│You cannot burn this door.
[3126]:	│The door is invulnerable.
[3130]:	│You cannot damage this door.
[3134]:	│The door is still under warranty.
[3139]:	│The machine comes to life (figuratively) with a dazzling display
	│of colored lights and bizarre noises.  After a few moments, the
	│excitement fades.
[3158]:	│The machine doesn't seem to want to do anything.
[3165]:	│A force keeps you from taking the bodies.
[3171]:	│The voice of the guardian of the dungeon booms out from the darkness,
	│"Your disrespect has cost you your life!" and places your head on a pole.
[3189]:	│The lights within the room shut off.
[3194]:	│The lights within the room come on.
[3199]:	│Click.
[3200]:	│There is a rumbling sound, and a stream of water appears to burst
	│from the east wall of the room (apparently, a leak has occurred
	│in a pipe).
[3218]:	│The blue button appears to be jammed.
[3223]:	│The boat must be on the ground to be inflated.
[3229]:	│The boat inflates and appears seaworthy.
[3235]:	│You don't have enough lung power to inflate it.
[3241]:	│This boat will not inflate since some cretin put a hole in it.
[3249]:	│Well done.  The boat is repaired.
[3254]:	│There is a hissing sound and the boat deflates.
[3260]:	│The boat deflates.
[3263]:	│You can't deflate the boat while you're in it.
[3269]:	│The boat must be on the ground to be deflated.
[3275]:	│Very good.
[3277]:	│The rainbow seems to have become somewhat run of the mill.
[3285]:	│Suddenly, the rainbow appears to become solid and, I venture,
	│walkable (I think the giveaway was the stairs and bannister).
[3301]:	│The structural integrity of the rainbow seems to have declined
	│precipitously, leaving you about 450 feet in the air, supported
	│by water vapor.
[3319]:	│The ballon is fastened to the hook.
[3324]:	│The balloon is not tied to anything.
[3329]:	│The wire falls off the hook.
[3333]:	│The box is imbedded in the wall.
[3338]:	│What do you expect, BOOM?
[3342]:	│The box has no door!
[3345]:	│The box is rusted and will not open.
[3350]:	│The box is not open, chomper!
[3354]:	│The wire starts to burn.
[3358]:	│"Thank you very much," he says.  "I don't believe I've seen a
	│# as beautiful.  Follow me."  A door appears on the west end
	│of the ledge.  Through the door, you can see a narrow chimney
	│sloping downward.  The gnome moves quickly, and he disappears
	│from sight.
[3391]:	│"That wasn't quite what I had in mind", he says, crunching
	│the # in his rock hard hands.
[3403]:	│The gnome appears increasingly nervous.
[3408]:	│Although the implementers are gone, they foresaw that some cretin
	│would tamper with their remains.  Therefore, they took steps to
	│prevent this.
[3426]:	│Unfortunately, we've run out of poles.  Therefore, in punishment for
	│your transgression, we shall deprive you of all your valuables, and
	│of your life.
[3445]:	│Congratulations!  You've managed to break all the bottles.  Fortunately
	│for your feet, they were made of magic glass and disappear immediately.
[3463]:	│As you reach for the sphere, an iron cage falls from the ceiling
	│to entrap you.  To make matters worse, poisonous gas starts coming
	│into the room.
[3482]:	│As the robot reaches for sphere, an iron cage falls from the
	│ceiling.  The robot attempts to fend it off but is trapped below it.
	│Alas, the robot short circuits in his vain attempt to escape and
	│crushes the sphere beneath him as he falls to the floor.
[3514]:	│There is a giant spark, and you are fried to a crisp.
[3521]:	│Nothing seems to happen.
[3525]:	│The whirring increases in intensity slightly.
[3531]:	│The whirring decreases in intensity slightly.
[3537]:	│A dull thump is heard in the distance.
[3542]:	│The flask breaks into pieces.
[3546]:	│Here noxious vapors prevent your entry.
[3551]:	│Just before you pass out, you notice that the vapors from the
	│flask's contents are fatal.
[3563]:	│Suddenly, the room appears to have become very large.
[3570]:	│The only writing visible is a capital E.  The rest is too small to
	│be clearly visible.
[3581]:	│You can't see through that!
[3585]:	│The letters appear larger but are still too small to read.
[3593]:	│The icing, now visible, says "EXPLODE".
[3598]:	│The icing, now visible, says "EVAPORATE".
[3604]:	│The icing, now visible, says "ENLARGE".
[3609]:	│The pool of water evaporates, revealing a tin of rare spices.
[3617]:	│The door to the room seems to be blocked by sticky orange rubble
	│from an explosion.  Probably some careless adventurer was playing
	│with blasting cakes.
[3636]:	│You have been blasted to smithereens (whatever they are).
[3644]:	│The room around you seems to be getting smaller.
[3651]:	│The room seems to have become too small to hold you.  It seems
	│that the walls are not as compressable as your body, which is
	│more or less demolished.
[3670]:	│The robot is injured (being of shoddy construction) and falls to the
	│floor in a pile of garbage, which disintegrates before your eyes.
[3687]:	│How romantic!
[3689]:	│If you must... Poof, you're dead!
[3694]:	│The grue is a sinister, lurking presence in the dark places of the
	│earth.  Its favorite diet is adventurers, but its insatiable
	│appetite is tempered by its fear of light.  No grue has ever been
	│seen by the light of day, and few have survived its fearsome jaws
	│to tell the tale.
[3729]:	│There is no grue here, but I'm sure there is at least one lurking in
	│the darkness nearby.  I wouldn't let my light go out if I were you!
[3747]:	│The bucket rises and comes to a stop.
[3752]:	│The bucket descends and comes to a stop.
[3758]:	│You notice that the # has burned out, and that
	│the cloth bag is starting to deflate.
[3769]:	│I hope you have more light than from a #.
[3775]:	│I didn't realize that adventurers are stupid enough to light a
	│# in a room which reeks of coal gas.  Fortunately,
	│there is still justice in the world.
[3794]:	│Oh, dear.  It appears that the smell coming from this room was coal
	│gas.  I would have thought twice about carrying a # in here.
[3811]:	│There is now a puddle in the middle of the #.
[3817]:	│The water leaks out of the # and evaporates immediately.
[3825]:	│You won't melt it with a #.
[3829]:	│The bolt can't be turned with your #.
[3834]:	│It seems that a # won't do.
[3838]:	│With a #?
[3840]:	│The robot gladly takes the # and nods his headlike
	│appendage in thanks.
[3849]:	│A #?  Surely you jest.
[3852]:	│He who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is not fit for the
	│kingdom of winners.  In any case, 'BACK' doesn't work.
[3868]:	│You'll have to speak up if you expect me to hear you.
[3875]:	│I don't know how to do that.  I win in all cases.
[3882]:	│At your service!
[3885]:	│The Frobozz Company, Ltd., created, owns, and operates this dungeon.
[3894]:	│Well, FOO, BAR, and BLETCH to you too!
[3899]:	│It could very well be too late.
[3903]:	│The dungeon is ALWAYS open (always room for one more).
[3910]:	│Naturally!
[3912]:	│AAAARRRRRRGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHH!
[3916]:	│Very good.  Now you can go to the second grade.
[3922]:	│Have you tried hopping around the dungeon, too?
[3928]:	│Are you enjoying yourself?
[3932]:	│Wheeeeee!
[3934]:	│Do you expect me to applaud?
[3938]:	│Such language in a high-class establishment like this!
[3945]:	│You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
[3950]:	│It's not so bad.  You could have been killed already.
[3957]:	│Tough shit, asshole.
[3960]:	│Oh, dear.  Such language from a supposedly winning adventurer!
[3968]:	│That word is henceforth replaced with DUNGEON.
[3974]:	│I think you are taking this thing for granite.
[3980]:	│Brief descriptions.
[3983]:	│Maximum verbosity.
[3986]:	│No long descriptions.
[3989]:	│You can see:  A #.
[3992]:	│Swimming is not allowed in this dungeon.
[3998]:	│I don't really see how.
[4001]:	│I think that swimming is best performed in water.
[4008]:	│Perhaps it is your head that is swimming.
[4014]:	│Wasn't he an Indian?
[4017]:	│I didn't think you would really try to go over the falls in a
	│barrel.  It seems that some 450 feet below, you were met by a number
	│of unfriendly rocks and boulders, causing your immediate demise.
[4042]:	│Wasn't he a sailor?
[4045]:	│The cyclops, hearing the name of his deadly nemesis, flees the room
	│by knocking down the wall on the north side of the room.
[4061]:	│There is a clap of thunder and the east door opens.
[4068]:	│Well what?
[4070]:	│If you pray enough, your prayers may be answered.
[4077]:	│Nothing happens.
[4080]:	│I don't really know how to do that.
[4085]:	│Do you wish to leave the game?
[4089]:	│Underneath the pile of leaves is a grating.
[4095]:	│Underneath the rug is a closed trap door.
[4101]:	│Hello.
[4102]:	│Good day.
[4104]:	│Nice weather we've been having lately.
[4109]:	│Goodbye.
[4111]:	│Here, nothing happens.
[4114]:	│Nothing happens here.
[4117]:	│I think that phrase is getting a bit worn out.
[4123]:	│You seem to be repeating yourself.
[4128]:	│The # bows his head to you in greeting.
[4133]:	│I think that only schizophrenics say hello to a #.
[4140]:	│It is impossible to read in the dark.
[4145]:	│How does one look through a #?
[4149]:	│How can I read a #?
[4152]:	│How, exactly, do I ring that?
[4156]:	│Ding, dong.
[4158]:	│I'm not sure that a # can be melted.
[4163]:	│If you wish, but I can't understand why.
[4169]:	│Dental hygiene is highly recommended, but I'm not sure what
	│you want to brush them with.
[4181]:	│A nice idea, but with a #?
[4185]:	│Well, you seem to have been brushing your teeth with some sort of
	│glue.  As a result, your mouth gets glued together with your nose,
	│and you die of respiratory failure.
[4207]:	│Unfortunately, the troll can't hear you.
[4213]:	│Inflating it further would probably burst it.
[4219]:	│How can you inflate that?
[4223]:	│Come on, now!
[4225]:	│The # isn't sleeping.
[4228]:	│This has no effect.
[4231]:	│does not seem to do anything useful
[4236]:	│is not notably useful
[4239]:	│isn't very interesting
[4242]:	│doesn't appear worthwhile
[4246]:	│has no effect
[4248]:	│doesn't do anything
[4251]:	│Kicking a # #.
[4253]:	│Waving a # #.
[4255]:	│Playing in this way with a # #.
[4259]:	│Fiddling with a # #.
[4262]:	│Pushing the # #.
[4265]:	│I don't think so.
[4268]:	│This cannot be tied, so it cannot be untied!
[4274]:	│How can you tie that to anything?
[4279]:	│You can't tie the # to that.
[4283]:	│You could certainly never tie the # with that!
[4289]:	│The # struggles and you cannot tie him up.
[4295]:	│Why would you tie up a #?
[4299]:	│You can't turn that.
[4302]:	│You certainly can't turn it with a #.
[4307]:	│Digging with the # is slow and tedious.
[4312]:	│Digging with a # is silly.
[4316]:	│I don't think that anybody is home.
[4321]:	│Why knock on a #?
[4324]:	│It sounds like there is something inside the #.
[4330]:	│The contents of the # spill out.
[4335]:	│I can't get to that to move it.
[4339]:	│You can't move the #.
[4342]:	│You can't turn that on.
[4345]:	│It is already on.
[4348]:	│You can't turn that off.
[4352]:	│It is already off.
[4355]:	│The # is now on.
[4358]:	│The # is now off.
[4361]:	│It is now pitch black.
[4364]:	│You must tell me how to do that to a #.
[4369]:	│The # cannot be opened.
[4372]:	│Opened.
[4373]:	│Opening the # reveals:
[4376]:	│The # cannot be closed.
[4379]:	│It is already open.
[4382]:	│It is already closed.
[4385]:	│Closed.
[4386]:	│There is a # here.
[4389]:	│You are carrying a #.
[4392]:	│It is in the #, which is in the room.
[4397]:	│It is in the #, which you are carrying.
[4402]:	│Time passes...
[4404]:	│The # must be on the ground to be boarded.
[4410]:	│I suppose you have a theory on boarding a #.
[4416]:	│You are already in the #, cretin!
[4421]:	│You are now in the #.
[4424]:	│You aren't in that!
[4427]:	│You realize, just in time, that disembarking here would probably
	│be fatal.
[4437]:	│You are on your own feet again.
[4441]:	│You can't go there without a vehicle.
[4446]:	│You can't go there in a #.
[4450]:	│I see nothing special about the #.
[4455]:	│It is pitch dark.  You are likely to be eaten by a grue.
[4463]:	│You are in the #.
[4466]:	│The # has died.
[4468]:	│The troll, disarmed, cowers in terror, pleading for his life in
	│the guttural tongue of the trolls.
[4481]:	│The troll, now worried about this encounter, recovers his
	│bloody axe.
[4490]:	│An unconscious troll is sprawled on the floor.  All passages out
	│of the room are open.
[4501]:	│A nasty-looking troll, brandishing a bloody axe, blocks all passages
	│out of the room.
[4512]:	│The troll stirs, quickly resuming a fighting stance.
[4519]:	│The troll spits in your face, saying "Better luck next time".
[4527]:	│The troll laughs at your puny gesture.
[4532]:	│The troll, who is remarkably coordinated, catches the #
[4539]:	│The troll, who is not overly proud, graciously accepts the gift
[4547]:	│and not having the most discriminating tastes, gleefully eats it.
[4556]:	│and being for the moment sated, throws it back.  Fortunately, the
	│troll has poor control, and the knife falls on the floor.  He does
	│not look pleased.
[4575]:	│Sadly, a # can't be put in a #.
[4579]:	│You can't take the #.
[4582]:	│Aren't you forgetting something?
[4587]:	│That would be a good trick.
[4591]:	│The # is too big to jump over.
[4595]:	│You should have looked before you leaped.
[4601]:	│I'm afraid that leap was a bit much for your weak frame.
[4609]:	│In the movies, your life would be passing in front of your eyes.
[4618]:	│Geronimo...
[4620]:	│I don't think that the # would agree with you.
[4626]:	│I think you should get that first.
[4631]:	│Thank you very much.  It really hit the spot.
[4637]:	│How can I drink that?
[4640]:	│I'd like to, but I can't get to that.
[4645]:	│Thank you very much.  I was rather thirsty, probably from all
	│this talking.
[4655]:	│The # catches fire.
[4658]:	│Unfortunately, you were holding it at the time.
[4664]:	│You don't have that.
[4667]:	│The # catches fire and is consumed.
[4672]:	│I don't think you can burn a #.
[4676]:	│It doesn't seem to work.
[4680]:	│Can you unlock a grating with a #?
[4685]:	│Munging a # #.
[4687]:	│Trying to kill a # #.
[4690]:	│Trying to attack a # #.
[4693]:	│There is nothing here to attack.
[4698]:	│I've known strange people, but attacking a #?
[4704]:	│with your bare hands is suicidal
[4709]:	│with that is very self-destructive
[4714]:	│You are in perfect health.
[4718]:	│You have a light wound.
[4721]:	│You have a serious wound.
[4725]:	│You have several wounds.
[4729]:	│You have serious wounds.
[4733]:	│You are at death's door.
[4737]:	│You can be killed by one more light wound.
[4743]:	│You can be killed by a serious wound.
[4748]:	│You can survive one serious wound.
[4753]:	│You are strong enough to take several wounds.
[4759]:	│You have been killed once.
[4763]:	│You have been killed twice.
[4767]:	│This gives you the rank of Cheater.
[4772]:	│This gives you the rank of Wizard.
[4777]:	│This gives you the rank of Master.
[4782]:	│This gives you the rank of Winner.
[4787]:	│This gives you the rank of Hacker.
[4792]:	│This gives you the rank of Adventurer.
[4797]:	│This gives you the rank of Junior Adventurer.
[4803]:	│This gives you the rank of Novice Adventurer.
[4809]:	│This gives you the rank of Amateur Adventurer.
[4815]:	│This gives you the rank of Beginner.
[4820]:	│Your sword is no longer glowing.
[4825]:	│Your sword is glowing with a faint blue glow.
[4831]:	│You sword has begun to glow very brightly.
[4837]:	│Annoyed to be left unarmed in such an obviously dangerous
	│neighborhood, the thief slips off into the shadows.
[4851]:	│The robber, somewhat surprised by this turn of events, nimbly
	│recovers his stilletto.
[4862]:	│His booty remains.
[4865]:	│As the thief dies, the power of his magic decreases, and his
	│treasures reappear:  A #.
[4876]:	│  A #.
[4877]:	│There is a suspicious-looking individual, holding a bag, leaning
	│against one wall.  He is armed with a vicious-looking stilletto.
[4894]:	│There is a suspicious-looking individual lying unconscious on the
	│ground.  His bag and stilletto seem to have vanished.
[4909]:	│The robber revives, briefly feigning continued unconsciousness, and
	│when he sees his moment, scrambles away from you.
[4924]:	│Once you got him, what would you do with him?
[4930]:	│You missed.  The thief makes no attempt to take the knife, although
	│it would be a fine addition to the collection in his bag.  He does
	│seem angered by your attempt.
[4951]:	│You evidently frightened the robber, although you missed him.  He flees.
[4961]:	│You evidently frightened the robber, although you missed him.  He flees,
	│but the contents of his bag fall on the floor.
[4976]:	│Your proposed victim suddenly recovers consciousness.
[4983]:	│The thief seems rather offended by your offer.  Do you think he's as
	│stupid as you are?
[4994]:	│The thief places the # in his bag and thanks you politely.
[5002]:	│The candles are not lit.
[5006]:	│The flame is extinguished.
[5010]:	│Alas, there's not much left of the candles.  Certainly not enough to
	│burn.
[5020]:	│With what?
[5022]:	│The candles are lit.
[5025]:	│The candles are already lit.
[5029]:	│You have to light them with something that's burning, you know.
[5037]:	│You realize just in time that the candles are already lit.
[5045]:	│The heat from the torch is so intense that the candles are vaporized.
[5054]:	│Oh, no!  You walked into the slavering fangs of a lurking grue.
[5062]:	│Oh, no!  A fearsome grue slithered into the room and devoured you.
[5071]:	│You can't go that way.
[5074]:	│The # is closed.
[5077]:	│I can't reach that.
[5080]:	│You aren't carrying that.
[5084]:	│Dropped.
[5086]:	│Thrown.
[5087]:	│You watch as the balloon slowly lands.
[5092]:	│The balloon has landed.
[5095]:	│You have landed, but the balloon did not survive.
[5102]:	│You watch as the balloon slowly descends.
[5108]:	│The balloon descends.
[5111]:	│You hear a boom and notice that the balloon is falling to the ground.
[5120]:	│Your balloon has hit the rim of the volcano, ripping the cloth and
	│causing you to drop 500 feet.  Did you get your flight insurance?
[5137]:	│You watch as the balloon slowly ascends.
[5143]:	│The balloon ascends.
[5146]:	│You watch as the balloon slowly floats away.  It seems to be ascending,
	│due to its light load.
[5158]:	│The balloon leaves the ledge.
[5162]:	│You watch as the balloon slowly lifts off.
[5168]:	│The balloon slowly rises from the ground.
[5174]:	│The cloth bag is draped over the side.
[5179]:	│The balloon is inflated, and there is a # burning
	│in the receptacle.
[5188]:	│The balloon is tied to the hook.
[5193]:	│I'm afraid you can't control the balloon in that way.
[5200]:	│You are tied to the ledge.
[5204]:	│You don't really want to hold a burning #.
[5210]:	│The receptacle is already occupied.
[5215]:	│The # burns inside the receptacle.
[5220]:	│The balloon inflates as it fills with hot air.
[5226]:	│Not likely.
[5228]:	│An interesting idea, but...
[5232]:	│A valiant attempt.
[5235]:	│You can't be serious.
[5238]:	│Not a prayer.
[5240]:	│You already have it.
[5243]:	│Your load is too heavy.  You will have to leave something behind.
[5252]:	│Taken.
[5253]:	│Nice try.
[5255]:	│I can't do that.
[5258]:	│I can't reach inside.
[5261]:	│How can you do that?
[5264]:	│The # is already in the #.
[5268]:	│It won't fit.
[5270]:	│I can't reach the #.
[5273]:	│The cage shakes and is hurled across the room.
[5279]:	│"I am sorry but that action is difficult in the absense of a mouth."
[5288]:	│"My vision is not that good without eyes."
[5294]:	│"I am only a stupid robot and cannot perform that command."
[5302]:	│ECHO
	│The acoustics of the room change subtly.
[5308]:	│Almost as soon as the # breathes his last, a cloud of
	│sinister black smoke envelops him, and when the fog lifts, the
	│carcass has disappeared.
[5326]:	│The # contains:
[5328]:	│Your collection of treasures consists of:
[5334]:	│You are carrying:
[5337]:	│The # is carrying:
[5340]:	│By some miracle of elven technology, you have managed to
	│stop the leak in the dam.
[5351]:	│You are empty handed.
[5354]:	│It is too dark in here to see.
[5358]:	│#:
[5359]:	│I could't find anything.
[5363]:	│I couldn't find any valuables.
[5367]:	│Someone carrying a large bag is casually leaning against one of the
	│walls here.  He does not speak, but it is clear from his aspect that
	│the bag will be taken only over his dead body.
[5390]:	│Your opponent, determining discretion to be the better part of
	│valor, decides to terminate this little contretemps.  With a rueful
	│nod of his head, he steps backward into the gloom and disappears.
[5415]:	│The holder of the large bag just left, looking disgusted.
	│Fortunately, he took nothing.
[5426]:	│A 'lean and hungry' gentleman just wandered through.  Finding
	│nothing of value, he left disgruntled.
[5439]:	│A seedy-looking individual with a large bag just wandered through
	│the room.  On the way, he quietly abstracted all valuables from the
	│room and from your possession, mumbling something about, "Do unto
	│others before...".
[5467]:	│The other occupant (he of the large bag), finding nothing of value,
	│left disgusted.
[5478]:	│The other occupant just left carrying his large bag.  You may not
	│have noticed that he robbed you blind first.
[5492]:	│Off in the distance you hear someone saying, "My, I wonder what this
	│fine # is doing here?"
[5504]:	│You are still recovering from the last blow, so your attack is
	│ineffective.
[5514]:	│Attacking a dead # is pointless.
[5519]:	│Well, you really did it that time.  Is suicide painless?
[5527]:	│The # slowly regains his feet.
[5531]:	│The unconscious # cannot defend himself:  he dies.
[5538]:	│It appears that the last blow was too much for you.  I'm afraid
	│that you are dead.
[5549]:	│Saved.
[5550]:	│I can't access the save file.
[5554]:	│Restored.
[5556]:	│Your save file is obsolete and cannot be restored.
[5563]:	│I don't understand that.
[5567]:	│You cannot talk to that!
[5571]:	│You cannot talk through another person.
[5576]:	│Please input the entire command again.
[5581]:	│Fortunately, you still have a #.
[5586]:	│You are in a room with an exit on the west side, and a staircase
	│leading up.
[5596]:	│A cyclops, who looks prepared to eat horses (much less mere
	│adventurers), blocks the staircase.  From his state of health
	│and the bloodstains on the wall, you gather that he is not very
	│friendly, though he likes people.
[5624]:	│The cyclops is standing in the corner, eyeing you closely.  I don't
	│think he likes you very much.  He looks extremely hungry, even for
	│a cyclops.
[5643]:	│The cyclops, having eaten the hot peppers, appears to be gasping.
	│His enflamed tongue protrudes from his man-sized mouth.
[5659]:	│The cyclops, perhaps affected by a drug in your drink, is sleeping
	│blissfully at the foot of the stairs.
[5673]:	│On the north of the room is a wall which used to be solid, but which
	│now has a cyclops-shaped hole in it.
[5687]:	│The bottle is closed.
[5690]:	│The bottle is already full.
[5694]:	│The bottle is now full of water.
[5699]:	│The water slips through your fingers.
[5704]:	│Too many prepositions.
[5707]:	│Too many objects.
[5710]:	│I can't see one here.
[5713]:	│Which one do you mean?
[5716]:	│I can't reach that from inside the #.
[5721]:	│What should I do with the #?
[5725]:	│Huh?
[5726]:	│You must supply a direct object.
[5731]:	│You must supply an indirect object.
[5736]:	│Normally, I would offer to patch you up, but I'm ashamed to say my
	│abilities are not equal to dealing with your present condition.
	│Please let me express my profoundest regrets.
[5759]:	│The thief, being temporarily incapacitated, is unable to acknowledge
	│your greeting with his usual graciousness.
[5773]:	│The thief is taken aback by your unexpected generosity but accepts
	│the # and stops to admire its beauty.
[5787]:	│The # is open, but I can't tell what's beyond it.
[5794]:	│The # is empty.
[5796]:	│I don't know how to look inside a #.
[5801]:	│There is nothing interesting there.
[5806]:	│The implementers are dead;  therefore, they do not respond.
[5814]:	│You can't wind a #.
[5817]:	│You hear in the distance the chirping of a song bird.
[5824]:	│A metallic voice says, "Hello, Intruder!  Your unauthorized presence
	│in the vault area of the Bank of Zork has set off all sorts of nasty
	│surprises, several of which seem to have been fatal.  This message
	│brought to you by the Frobozz Magic Alarm Company."
[5857]:	│An epicene Gnome of Zurich, wearing a three-piece suit and carrying a
	│safety deposit box, materializes in the room.  "You seem to have
	│forgotten to deposit your valuables," he says, tapping the lid of the
	│box impatiently.  "We don't usually allow customers to use the boxes
	│here, but we can make this ONE exception, I suppose..."  He looks
	│askance at you over his wire-rimmed bifocals.
[5906]:	│The gnome looks impatient:  "I may have another customer waiting;
	│you'll just have to fend for yourself, I'm afraid."  He disappears,
	│leaving you alone in the bare room.
[5928]:	│Talk about eating rich foods!
[5932]:	│Nothing like having money to burn!
[5937]:	│"I wouldn't put THAT in a safety deposit box," remarks the gnome with
	│disdain, tossing it over his shoulder, where it disappears with an
	│understated "pop".
[5957]:	│The gnome carefully places the # in the
	│deposit box.  "Let me show you the way out," he says, making it clear
	│that he will be pleased to see the last of you.  Then, you are momentarily
	│disoriented, and when you recover, you are back at the Bank Entrance.
[5989]:	│The gnome says, "Well, I never!" and disappears with a snap of his
	│fingers, leaving you alone.
[6001]:	│The gnome appears increasingly impatient.
[6007]:	│There is an unpleasant grinding noise from inside the canary.
[6015]:	│The canary chirps blithely, if somewhat tinnily, for a short time.
[6024]:	│The canary chirps, slightly off key, an aria from a forgotten opera.
	│From out of the greenery flies a lovely song bird.  It perches on a
	│limb just over your head and opens its beak to sing.  As it does so,
	│a beautiful brass bauble drops from its mouth, bounces off the top
	│of your head, and lands glimmering in the grass.  As the canary winds
	│down, the song bird flies away.
[6071]:	│The cliff is too steep for climbing.
[6076]:	│The egg is already open.
[6080]:	│There is no obvious way to open the egg.
[6086]:	│I doubt you could do that without damaging it.
[6092]:	│The egg is now open, but the clumsiness of your attempt has
	│seriously diminished its esthetic appeal.
[6105]:	│The concept of using a # is certainly original.
[6111]:	│Not to say that using a # isn't original either...
[6118]:	│You rather indelicate handling of the egg has caused it some damage.
	│The egg is now open.
[6130]:	│Climbing the walls is of no avail.
[6135]:	│Bizarre!
[6137]:	│The egg falls to the ground and is seriously damaged.
[6144]:	│The # falls to the ground.
[6148]:	│You are about ten feet above the ground nestled among some large
	│branches.  The nearest branch above you is beyond your reach.
[6164]:	│On the ground below you can see:
[6169]:	│I can't see any wall here.
[6173]:	│That cannot be turned.
[6176]:	│You would be lost without me.
[6180]:	│You don't have the #.
[6183]:	│The song bird is not here, but it is probably nearby.
[6190]:	│I can't see any song bird here.
[6194]:	│You feel somewhat disoriented as you pass through...
[6201]:	│You hit your head against the # as you attempt this feat.
[6209]:	│You can't go more than part way through the curtain.
[6216]:	│That would involve quite a contortion!
[6221]:	│You are in it, turkey!
[6224]:	│As you try, your hand seems to go through it.
[6230]:	│The # goes through it.
[6233]:	│The # passes through the wall and vanishes.
[6239]:	│The curtain dims slightly as the # passes through.
[6246]:	│I can't do that with everything at once.
[6252]:	│There is a wall there.
[6255]:	│There is no way up.
[6258]:	│There is no way down.
[6261]:	│You are in part of the long hallway.  The east and west walls are
	│dressed stone.  In the center of the hall is a shallow stone channel.
	│In the center of the room the channel widens into a large hole around
	│which is engraved a compass rose.
[6291]:	│Somewhat to the south, identical stone statues face each other from
	│pedestals on opposite sides of the corridor.  The statues represent
	│Guardians of Zork, a military order of ancient lineage.  They are
	│portrayed as heavily armored warriors standing at ease, hands clasped
	│around formidable bludgeons.

	│Guardians of Zork, a military order of ancient lineage.  They are
	│portrayed as heavily armored warriors standing at ease, hands clasped
	│around formidable bludgeons.
[6367]:	│A passage enters from the south.
[6372]:	│The Guardians awake and, in perfect unison, destroy you with
	│their stone bludgeons.  Satisfied, they resume their posts.
[6388]:	│To the north and south are large hallways.
[6394]:	│To the north is a large hallway.
[6399]:	│You are inside a rectangular box of wood whose structure is rather
	│complicated.  Four sides and the roof are filled in, and the floor
	│is open.
	│   As you face the side opposite the entrance, two short sides of
	│carved and polished wood are to your left and right.  The left panel
	│is mahogany, the right pine.  The wall you face is red on its left
	│half and black on its right.  On the entrance side, the wall is white
	│opposite the red part of the wall it faces, and yellow opposite the
	│black section.  The painted walls are at least twice the length of
	│the unpainted ones.  The ceiling is painted blue.
	│   In the floor is a stone channel about six inches wide and a foot
	│deep.  The channel is oriented in a north-south direction.  In the
	│exact center of the room the channel widens into a circular
	│depression perhaps two feet wide.  Incised in the stone around this
	│area is a compass rose.
	│   Running from one short wall to the other at about waist height
	│is a wooden bar, carefully carved and drilled.  This bar is pierced
	│in two places.  The first hole is in the center of the bar (and thus
	│in the center of the room).  The second is at the left end of the room
	│(as you face opposite the entrance).  Through each hole runs a wooden
	│pole.
	│   The pole at the left end of the bar is short, extending about a
[6562]:	│foot above the bar, and ends in a hand grip.  The pole is resting on
	│the stone floor.
[6573]:	│foot above the bar, and ends in a hand grip.  The pole has been
	│dropped into a hole carved in the stone floor.
[6587]:	│foot above the bar, and ends in a hand grip.  The pole has been lifted
	│out of a hole carved in the stone floor.  There is evidently enough
	│friction to keep the pole from dropping back down.
[6611]:	│foot above the bar, and ends in a hand grip.  The pole has been
	│dropped into the stone channel incised in the floor.
[6626]:	│foot above the bar, and ends in a hand grip.  The pole is positioned
	│above the stone channel in the floor.
[6640]:	│   The long pole at the center of the bar extends from the ceiling
	│through the bar to the circular area in the stone channel.  The
	│bottom end of this pole has a T-bar a bit less than two feet long
	│attached to it.  On the T-bar is carved an arrow.  The arrow and
	│T-bar are pointing #.

[6709]:	│You are in a small room, with narrow passages exiting to the north
	│and south.  A narrow red beam of light crosses the room at the north
	│end, inches above the floor.  The beam is stopped halfway across the
	│room by a # lying on the floor.
[6739]:	│Though large and esthetically pleasing, the crypt is empty;  the
	│sarcophagi, bodies, and rich treasures to be expected in a tomb of
	│this magnificence are missing.  Inscribed on the wall is the motto of
	│the implementers, "Feel Free".  There is a door leading out of the
	│crypt to the south.  The door is #.
[6778]:	│You are in an east-west corridor which turns north at its eastern
	│and western ends.  The walls of the corridor are marble.  An
	│additional passage leads south at the center of the corridor.
[6802]:	│In the center of the north wall of the passage is a bronze door
	│which is #.
[6812]:	│You are in a narrow north-south corridor.  At the south end is a door
	│and at the north end is an east-west corridor.  The door is #.
[6829]:	│You are in a north-south hallway which ends in a large wooden door.
[6838]:	│The wooden door has a barred panel in it at about head height.  The
	│panel is #, and the door is #.
[6851]:	│You are in a large east-west corridor which opens out to a northern
	│parapet at its center.  You can see flames and smoke as you peer
	│towards the parapet.  The corridor turns south at its east and west
	│ends, and due south is a massive wooden door.  In the door is a small
	│window barred with iron.  The door is #.
[6890]:	│You are standing behind a stone retaining wall which rims a large
	│parapet overlooking a fiery pit.  It is difficult to see through the
	│smoke and flame which fills the pit, but it seems to be more or less
	│bottomless.  It also extends upwards out of sight.  The pit itself
	│is of roughly dressed stone and is circular in shape.  It is about
	│two hundred feet in diameter.  The flames generate considerable heat,
	│so it is rather uncomfortable standing here.
	│   There is an object here which looks like a sundial.  On it are
	│an indicator arrow and (in the center) a large button.  On the face
	│of the dial are numbers "one" through "eight".  The indicator points
	│to the number "#".
[6975]:	│one
[6976]:	│two
[6977]:	│three
[6978]:	│four
[6979]:	│five
[6980]:	│six
[6981]:	│seven
[6982]:	│eight
[6983]:	│You are in a featureless prison cell.  You can see only the flames
	│and smoke from the pit out of the small window in the closed door
	│in front of you.
[7002]:	│You are in a featureless prison cell.  You can see the east-west
	│corridor outside the open wooden door in front of you.
[7017]:	│Behind you is a bronze door which seems to be #.
[7024]:	│You are in a featureless prison cell.  Its wooden door is securely
	│fastened, and you can see only the flames and smoke of the pit out
	│its small window.
[7043]:	│You are in a featureless prison cell.  Its wooden door is securely
	│fastened, and you can see only the flames and smoke of the pit out
	│its small window.  On the other side of the cell is a bronze door
	│which seems to be #.
[7071]:	│   As you gleefully examine your new-found riches, the dungeon
	│master himself materializes beside you and says, "Now that you have
	│solved all the mysteries of the dungeon, it is time for you to assume
	│your rightfully-earned place in the scheme of things.  Long have I
	│waited for one capable of releasing me from my burden!"  He taps you
	│lightly on the head with his staff and mumbles a few well-chosen spells.
	│You feel yourself changing, growing older and more stooped.  For a
	│moment there are two identical mages staring at each other among the
	│treasures, then you watch as your counterpart dissolves into a mist
	│and disappears, a sardonic grin on his face.
[7154]:	│Suddenly, as you wait in the dark, you begin to feel somewhat
	│disoriented.  The feeling passes, but something seems different.
	│As you regain your composure, the cloaked figure appears before you
	│and says, "You are now ready to face the ultimate challenge of
	│Zork.  Should you wish to do this somewhat more quickly in the
	│future, you will be given a magic phrase which will at any time
	│transport you by magic to this point.  To select the phrase, say
	│	INCANT, <word>
	│and you will be told your own magic phrase to use by saying
	│	INCANT, <phrase>
	│Good luck, and choose wisely!"
[7226]:	│The button pops back to its original position.
[7232]:	│The mirror quietly swings shut.
[7236]:	│The pine wall closes quietly.
[7240]:	│The structure shakes slightly but doesn't move.
[7246]:	│The short pole prevents the structure from rotating.
[7253]:	│The movement of the structure alerts the Guardians.
[7260]:	│The arrow on the compass rose now indicates #.
[7266]:	│The structure rocks back and forth slightly but doesn't move.
[7274]:	│The pine wall swings open.
[7278]:	│The pine door opens into the field of view of the Guardians.
[7286]:	│The structure has reached the end of the stone channel and won't
	│budge.
[7295]:	│The structure slides # and stops over another compass rose.
[7303]:	│The structure wobbles # and stops over another compass rose.
[7311]:	│The structure wobbles as it moves, alerting the Guardians.
[7319]:	│The Guardian notices a wooden structure creeping by, and his
	│suspicions are aroused.
[7330]:	│Suddenly, the Guardians realize that someone is trying to sneak by
	│them in the structure.  They awake and, in perfect unison, hammer
	│the box and its contents (including you) to a pulp.  Satisfied, they
	│resume their posts.
[7358]:	│A Guardian notices the open side of the structure, and his suspicions
	│are aroused.
[7369]:	│Attacking the Guardians is about as futile as attacking a stone wall.
	│Unfortunately for you, your futile blow attracts their attention, and
	│they manage to dispatch you effortlessly.
[7392]:	│The statues are impassive.
[7396]:	│The dungeon master is taken momentarily by surprise.  He dodges your
	│blow and then, with a disappointed expression on his face, he raises
	│his staff and traces a complicated pattern in the air.  As it
	│completes you crumble into dust.
[7426]:	│"I'm willing to accompany you, but not to ride in your pocket!"
[7434]:	│The pole is now slightly above the floor.
[7440]:	│The pole cannot be raised further.
[7445]:	│The pole cannot be lowered further.
[7450]:	│The pole is lowered into the channel.
[7455]:	│The pole is lowered into the stone hole.
[7461]:	│The pole is already resting on the floor.
[7467]:	│The pole now rests on the stone floor.
[7472]:	│The button becomes depressed.
[7476]:	│The button pops back out.
[7480]:	│The button is already depressed.
[7485]:	│No doubt you have a bottle of moonbeams as well.
[7492]:	│The beam is now interrupted by a # lying on the floor.
[7499]:	│You can't break the beam with a #.
[7504]:	│The # already breaks the beam.
[7508]:	│I see no bronze door here.
[7512]:	│The bronze door opens.
[7515]:	│The bronze door closes.
[7518]:	│On the other side of the door is a narrow passage which opens out
	│into a larger area.
[7529]:	│The door won't budge.
[7532]:	│The knock reverberates along the hall.  For a time it seems there
	│will be no answer.  Then you hear someone unlatching the small wooden
	│panel.  Through the bars of the great door, the wrinkled face of an
	│old man appears.  He gazes down at you and intones as follows:
	│   "I am the master of the dungeon, whose task it is to insure
	│that none but the most scholarly and masterful adventurers are
	│admitted into the secret realms of the dungeon.  To ascertain whether
	│you meet the stringent requirements laid down by the Great
	│Implementers, I will ask three questions which should be easy for
	│one of your reputed excellence to answer.  You have undoubtedly
	│discovered the answers during your travels through the dungeon.
	│Should you answer each of these questions correctly within five
	│attempts, then I am obliged to acknowledge your skill and daring and
	│admit you to these regions.
	│   "All answers should be in the form 'ANSWER, <answer>'."
[7649]:	│The booming voice asks:
[7652]:	│"From which room can one enter the robber's hideaway without passing
	│through the cyclops room?"
[7664]:	│"Beside the Temple, to which room is it possible to go from the Altar?"
[7673]:	│"What is the absolute minimum specified value of the Zorkmid
	│treasures, in Zorkmids?"
[7684]:	│"What object is of use in determining the function of the iced cakes?"
[7693]:	│"What can be done to the mirror that is useful?"
[7700]:	│"The taking of which object offends the ghosts?"
[7707]:	│"What object in the dungeon is haunted?"
[7713]:	│"In which room is the phrase 'Hello sailor' useful?"
[7720]:	│The door is securely fastened.
[7724]:	│The wooden door opens.
[7727]:	│The wooden door closes.
[7730]:	│The dungeon master says, "I will stay."
[7735]:	│The dungeon master says, "I will follow."
[7741]:	│There is no reply.
[7744]:	│"I prefer to stay where I am, thank you."
[7750]:	│"I am not permitted to enter the prison cell."
[7756]:	│"I cannot perform that action for you."
[7761]:	│This gives you the rank of Dungeon Master.
[7767]:	│This gives you the rank of Super Cheater.
[7773]:	│This gives you the rank of Master Cheater.
[7779]:	│This gives you the rank of Advanced Cheater.
[7785]:	│You are in the Tomb of the Unknown Implementer.  A hollow voice
	│says, "That's not a bug, it's a feature!"
	│In the north wall of the room is the Crypt of the Implementers.  It
	│is made of the finest marble and is apparently large enough for four
	│headless corpses.  The crypt is #.  Above the entrance is the
	│cryptic inscription:
	│
	│		"Feel Free".
[7828]:	│The door of the crypt is extremely heavy, but it opens easily.
[7836]:	│The crypt is already open.
[7840]:	│The crypt is already closed.
[7844]:	│The crypt is closed.
[7847]:	│The dial spins and comes to a stop pointing at "#".
[7854]:	│There is no answer.
[7857]:	│No one seems to be listening.
[7861]:	│The dungeon master says, "Excellent."
[7866]:	│The dungeon master says, "You are wrong.  You have four more chances."
[7875]:	│The dungeon master says, "You are wrong.  You have three more chances."
[7884]:	│The dungeon master says, "You are wrong.  You have two more chances."
[7893]:	│The dungeon master says, "You are wrong.  You have one more chance."
[7902]:	│The mirror is closed.
[7905]:	│You must specify what to set the dial to.
[7911]:	│The dial face contains only numbers.
[7916]:	│The dial now points to "#".
[7920]:	│The button depresses with a slight click and pops back.
[7927]:	│The cell door is now closed.
[7931]:	│You notice that the dungeon master does not follow.
[7938]:	│The dungeon master catches up with you.
[7943]:	│The dungeon master follows you.
[7947]:	│There is a wooden wall blocking your way.
[7953]:	│There is a large mirror blocking your way.
[7959]:	│There is a large broken mirror blocking your way.
[7966]:	│The structure blocks your way.
[7970]:	│As you leave, the door swings shut.
[7975]:	│You are in a narrow room whose west wall is a large mirror.
[7983]:	│You are in a narrow room whose east wall is a large mirror.
[7991]:	│You are in a narrow room whose west wall is a large wooden panel
	│which once contained a mirror.
[8003]:	│You are in a narrow room whose east wall is a large wooden panel
	│which once contained a mirror.
[8015]:	│The mirror is mounted on a panel which has been opened outward.
[8023]:	│The panel has been opened outward.
[8028]:	│The opposite wall is solid rock.
[8033]:	│The dungeon master says, "You are wrong."  The dungeon master,
	│obviously disappointed in your lack of knowledge, shakes his head
	│and mumbles, "I guess they'll let anyone in the dungeon these days."
	│With that, he departs.
[8061]:	│The dungeon master, obviously pleased, says, "You are indeed a
	│master of lore.  I am proud to be at your service."  The massive
	│wooden door swings open, and the master motions for you to enter.
[8086]:	│Saves are not permitted during the endgame.
[8092]:	│Restores are not permitted during the endgame.
[8098]:	│The structure rotates clockwise.
[8103]:	│The structure rotates counterclockwise.
[8108]:	│I can't see a mirror here.
[8112]:	│I don't see any way to open the mirror here.
[8118]:	│The mirror breaks, revealing a panel behind it.
[8124]:	│The mirror has already been broken.
[8129]:	│The mirror is mounted on a wooden panel which moves slightly inward
	│as you push and back out as you let go.  The mirror feels rather
	│fragile.
[8147]:	│The mirror is unyielding but seems rather fragile.
[8154]:	│I can't see a panel here.
[8158]:	│I don't see any way to open the panel here.
[8164]:	│To break the panel you would have to break the mirror first.
[8172]:	│The panel is not that easily destroyed.
[8177]:	│The wooden panel moves slightly inward as you push and back out
	│when you let go.
[8188]:	│The panel is unyielding.
[8192]:	│A disheveled adventurer stares back at you.
[8198]:	│The mirror is broken into little pieces.
[8204]:	│Shards of a broken mirror are dangerous to play with.
[8211]:	│The # side of the room is divided by a wooden wall into small
[8219]:	│hallways to the #east and #west.
[8224]:	│A large mirror fills the # side of the hallway.
[8230]:	│A large panel fills the # side of the hallway.
[8236]:	│The shattered pieces of a mirror cover the floor.
[8243]:	│The corridor continues north.
[8247]:	│The corridor continues south.
[8251]:	│The corridor continues north and south.
[8256]:	│Incantations are useless once you have gotten this far.
[8263]:	│That incantation seems to have been a failure.
[8269]:	│Sorry, only one incantation to a customer.
[8275]:	│That spell has no obvious effect.
[8280]:	│As the last syllable of your spell fades into silence, darkness
	│envelops you, and the earth shakes.  Then all is quiet.
[8295]:	│The structure won't budge.
[8299]:	│You are in a room with an exit to the north and a steel door to the east.
[8309]:	│You are in a room with an exit to the north and a passage to the east.
[8318]:	│The card slides easily into the slot and vanishes, and the steel
	│door slides open, revealing a passageway to the west.  A moment
	│later, a previously unseen sign flashes:
	│	"Unauthorized/Illegal Use of Pass Card -- Card Confiscated"
[8347]:	│The item vanishes into the slot.  A moment later, a previously
	│unseen sign flashes "Garbage In, Garbage Out".  The #,
	│now atomized, spews through the slot.
[8367]:	│I can't see any ladder here.
[8371]:	│Come, come!
[8373]:	│You hit your head on the ceiling and fall off the ladder.
[8381]:	│You are in a small square room bounded to the north and west with
	│marble walls and to the east and south with sandstone walls.
[8397]:	│It appears the thief was correct.
[8402]:	│In the ceiling above you is a large circular opening.
[8409]:	│The center of the floor is noticeably depressed here.
[8416]:	│The west wall here has a large steel door at its center.  On one side
	│of the door is a small slit.
[8429]:	│The west wall here has a large opening at its center.  On one side
	│of the opening in a small slit.
[8442]:	│There is a ladder here, firmly attached to the east wall.
[8450]:	│There is a ladder here, firmly attached to the west wall.
[8458]:	│There is only a passage in that direction.
[8464]:	│The wall does not budge.
[8468]:	│The wall slides forward and you follow it...
	│The architecture of this region is getting complex, so that further
	│descriptions will be diagrams of the immediate vicinity in a 3x3
	│grid.  The walls here are rock, but of two different types - sandstone
	│and marble.  The following notations will be used:
	│			..  = current position (middle of grid)
	│			MM  = marble wall
	│			SS  = sandstone wall
	│			??  = unknown (blocked by walls).
[8522]:	│The wall slides forward and you follow it to the following position:
[8531]:	│Your position is as follows:
[8535]:	│The exit is too far above your head.
[8540]:	│With the help of the ladder, you exit the puzzle.
[8547]:	│Don't be lazy, type the command yourself.
[8553]:	│In the MDL sources, NOOBJ is described as a "hack".  As we are
	│above such practices, NOOBJ is not implemented.
[8567]:	│The grating closes.
[8570]:	│Your swing misses the # by an inch.
[8575]:	│A mightly blow, but it misses the # by a mile.
[8581]:	│You charge, but the # jumps nimbly aside.
[8587]:	│Clang!  Crash!  The # parries.
[8591]:	│A good stroke, but it's too slow, the # dodges.
[8597]:	│Your sword crashes down, knocking the # into dreamland.
[8604]:	│The # is battered into unconsciousness.
[8609]:	│A furious exchange, and the # is knocked out.
[8615]:	│It's curtains for the # as your sword removes his head.
[8622]:	│The fatal blow strikes the # square in the heart:  he dies.
[8630]:	│The # takes a final blow and slumps to the floor dead.
[8637]:	│The # is struck on the arm, blood begins to trickle down.
[8645]:	│Your sword pinks the # on the wrist, but it's not serious.
[8653]:	│Your stroke lands, but it was only the flat of the blade.
[8661]:	│The blow lands, making a shallow gash in the #'s arm.
[8668]:	│The # receives a deep gash in his side.
[8673]:	│A savage blow on the thigh!  The # is stunned but can still fight.
[8682]:	│Slash!  Your blow lands!  That one hit an artery, it could be serious!
[8691]:	│The # is staggered and drops to his knees.
[8697]:	│The # is momentarily disoriented and can't fight back.
[8704]:	│The force of your blow knocks the # back, stunned.
[8711]:	│The #'s weapon is knocked to the floor, leaving him unarmed.
[8719]:	│Your stab misses the # by an inch.
[8724]:	│A good slash, but it misses the # by a mile.
[8730]:	│A quick stroke, but the # is on guard.
[8735]:	│The haft of your blade knocks out the #.
[8741]:	│The # drops to his knees, unconscious.
[8746]:	│The # is knocked out!
[8749]:	│It's the end for the # as your knife severs his jugular.
[8757]:	│The fatal thrust strikes the # square in the heart.
[8764]:	│The # is slashed on the arm, blood begins to trickle down.
[8772]:	│Your knife point pinks the # on the wrist, but it's not serious.
[8781]:	│A savage cut on the leg stuns the #, but he can still fight.
[8789]:	│Slash!  Your stroke connects!  The # could be in serious trouble!
[8798]:	│The # drops to his knees, staggered.
[8803]:	│The # is confused and can't fight back.
[8808]:	│The quickness of your thrust knocks the # back, staggered.
[8816]:	│The # is disarmed by a subtle feint past his guard.
[8823]:	│The cyclops misses, but the backwash almost knocks you over.
[8831]:	│The cyclops rushes you but runs into the wall.
[8837]:	│The cyclops trips over his feet trying to get at you.
[8844]:	│The cyclops unleashes a roundhouse punch, but you have time to dodge.
[8853]:	│The cyclops knocks you unconscious.
[8858]:	│The cyclops sends you crashing to the floor, unconscious.
[8866]:	│The cyclops raises his arms and crushes your skull.
[8873]:	│The cyclops has just essentially ripped you to shreds.
[8880]:	│The cyclops decks you.  In fact, you are dead.
[8886]:	│The cyclops breaks your neck with a massive smash.
[8893]:	│A quick punch, but it was only a glancing blow.
[8899]:	│The cyclops grabs but you twist free, leaving part of your cloak.
[8908]:	│A glancing blow from the cyclops' fist.
[8913]:	│The cyclops chops at you with the side of his hand and connects, but
	│not solidly.
[8924]:	│The cyclops gets a good grip and breaks your arm.
[8931]:	│The cyclops knocks the wind out of you with a quick punch.
[8939]:	│The cyclops smashes his huge fist into your chest, breaking several ribs.
[8949]:	│A flying drop kick breaks your jaw.
[8954]:	│The cyclops breaks your leg with a staggering blow.
[8961]:	│The cyclops knocks you silly, and you reel back.
[8968]:	│The cyclops grabs you and almost strangles you before you wiggle free,
	│breathless.
[8979]:	│Heedless of your weapons, the cyclops tosses you against the rock
	│wall of the room.
[8990]:	│The cyclops lands a punch that knocks the wind out of you.
[8998]:	│The cyclops grabs you by the arm, and you drop your #.
[9005]:	│The cyclops kicks your # out of your hand.
[9011]:	│The monster grabs you on the wrist, squeezes, and you drop
	│your # in pain.
[9021]:	│The cyclops grabs your #, tastes it, and throws it to the
	│ground in disgust.
[9031]:	│The cyclops is so excited by his success that he neglects to kill you.
[9040]:	│The cyclops, momentarily overcome by remorse, holds back.
[9048]:	│The cyclops seems unable to decide whether to broil or stew his dinner.
[9057]:	│The cyclops, no sportsman, dispatches his unconscious victim.
[9065]:	│The troll swings his axe, but it misses.
[9071]:	│The troll's axe barely misses your ear.
[9076]:	│The axe sweeps past you as you jump aside.
[9082]:	│The axe crashes against the rock, throwing sparks.
[9089]:	│The flat of the troll's axe hits you delicately on the head, knocking
	│you out.
[9099]:	│The troll lands a killing blow.  You are dead.
[9105]:	│The troll neatly removes your head.
[9110]:	│The troll's axe cleaves you from the nave to the chops.
[9117]:	│The troll's axe bashes in your skull.
[9122]:	│The axe gets you right in the side.  Ouch!
[9128]:	│The flat of the troll's axe skins across your forearm.
[9135]:	│The troll's swing almost knocks you over as you barely parry in time.
[9144]:	│The troll swings his axe, and it nicks your arm as you dodge.
[9152]:	│The troll charges, and his axe slashes you on your # arm.
[9160]:	│The troll's axe swings down, gashing your shoulder.
[9167]:	│An axe stroke makes a deep wound in your leg.
[9173]:	│The troll sees a hole in your defense, and a lightning stroke opens a
	│deep wound in your left side.
[9186]:	│The troll hits you with a glancing blow, and you are momentarily stunned.
[9196]:	│The troll swings.  The blade turns on your armor but crashes broadside
	│into your head.
[9207]:	│You stagger back under a hail of strokes.
[9213]:	│The troll's mighty blow drops you to your knees.
[9220]:	│The axe hits your # and sends it spinning.
[9226]:	│The troll swings.  You parry, but the force of his blow disarms you.
[9235]:	│The axe knocks your # out of your hand.  It falls to the floor.
[9243]:	│You parry the blow, but your # is knocked from your hand.
[9251]:	│The troll strikes at your unconscious form but misses in his rage.
[9260]:	│The troll hesitates, fingering his axe.
[9265]:	│The troll scratches his head ruminatively.  Might you be magically
	│protected, he wonders?
[9277]:	│The troll seems afraid to approach your crumpled form.
[9284]:	│Conquering his fears, the troll puts you to death.
[9291]:	│The thief stabs nonchalantly with his stilletto and misses.
[9299]:	│You dodge as the thief comes in low.
[9304]:	│You parry a lightning thrust, and the thief salutes you with a
	│grim nod.
[9314]:	│The thief tries to sneak past your guard, but you twist away.
[9322]:	│Shifting in the midst of a thrust, the thief knocks you unconscious
	│with the haft of his stilletto.
[9335]:	│The thief knocks you out.
[9339]:	│Finishing you off, a lightning throw right to the heart.
[9347]:	│The stilletto severs your jugular.  It looks like the end.
[9355]:	│The thief comes in from the side, feints, and slips the blade
	│between your ribs.
[9366]:	│The thief bows formally, raises his stilletto, and with a wry grin
	│ends the battle and your life.
[9379]:	│A quick thrust pinks your left arm, and blood starts to trickle
	│down.
[9388]:	│Raking his stilletto across your arm, the thief draws blood.
[9396]:	│The stilletto flashes faster than you can follow, and blood
	│wells from your leg.
[9407]:	│The thief slowly approaches, strikes like a snake, and leaves you
	│wounded.
[9417]:	│The thief strikes like a snake!  The resulting wound is serious.
[9426]:	│The thief stabs a deep cut in your upper arm.
[9432]:	│The stilletto touches your forehead, and the welling blood obscures
	│your vision.
[9443]:	│The thief strikes at your wrist, and suddenly your grip is slippery
	│with blood.
[9453]:	│The butt of his stilletto cracks you on the skull, and you stagger back.
[9463]:	│You are forced back and trip over your own feet, falling heavily to
	│the floor.
[9473]:	│The thief rams the haft of his blade into your stomach, leaving you
	│out of breath.
[9484]:	│The thief attacks, and you fall back desperately.
[9491]:	│A long theatrical slash.  You parry it desperately, but the thief
	│twists his knife, and your # goes flying.
[9505]:	│The thief neatly flips your # out of your hands, and it drops to the
	│floor.
[9515]:	│You parry a low thrust, and your # slips out of your hand.
[9523]:	│Avoiding the thief's stilletto, you stumble to the floor, dropping
	│your #.
[9533]:	│The thief, a man of good breeding, refrains from attacking a helpless
	│opponent.
[9543]:	│The thief amuses himself by searching your pockets.
[9550]:	│The thief entertains himself by rifling your pack.
[9557]:	│The thief, noticing you beginning to stir, reluctantly finishes you off.
[9567]:	│The thief, forgetting his essentially genteel upbringing, cuts your
	│throat.
[9577]:	│The thief, who is essentially a pragmatist, dispatches you as a threat
	│to his livelihood.
[9589]:	│You are in a narrow east-west passageway.  There is a narrow staircase
	│leading down at the north end of the room.
[9604]:	│East-West Passage
[9607]:	│You are in an open field west of a big white house with a boarded
	│front door.
[9617]:	│West of House
[9619]:	│You are facing the north side of a white house.  There is no door here,
	│and all the windows are barred.
[9632]:	│North of House
[9634]:	│You are facing the south side of a white house.  There is no door here,
	│and all the windows are barred.
[9647]:	│South of House
[9649]:	│Behind House
[9651]:	│Kitchen
[9652]:	│You are in the attic.  The only exit is stairs that lead down.
[9660]:	│Attic
[9661]:	│Living Room
[9663]:	│Cellar
[9664]:	│You are in a small room with passages off in all directions.
	│Bloodstains and deep scratches (perhaps made by an axe) mar the walls.
[9681]:	│Troll Room
[9683]:	│You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
[9690]:	│Maze
[9691]:	│Dead end.
[9693]:	│Dead End
[9695]:	│Grating room
[9697]:	│You are in a forest, with trees in all directions around you.
[9705]:	│Forest
[9706]:	│You are in a dimly lit forest, with large trees all around.  To the
	│east, there appears to be sunlight.
[9719]:	│You are in a dimly lit forest, with large trees all around.  One
	│particularly large tree with some low branches stands here.
[9735]:	│You are in a large forest, with trees obstructing all views except
	│to the east, where a small clearing may be seen.
[9750]:	│Clearing
[9752]:	│You are in a deep ravine at a crossing with an east-west crawlway.
	│Some stone steps are at the south of the ravine and a steep staircase
	│descends.
[9771]:	│Deep Ravine
[9773]:	│You are in a crawlway with a three foot high ceiling.  Your footing
	│is very unsure here due to the assortment of rocks undefoot.  Passages
	│can be seen in the east, west, and northwest corners of the crawlway.
[9800]:	│Rocky Crawl
[9802]:	│Reservoir South
[9804]:	│Reservoir
[9806]:	│Reservoir North
[9808]:	│You are standing on a path beside a gently flowing stream.  The path
	│travels to the north and the east.
[9821]:	│Stream View
[9823]:	│You are on the gently flowing stream.  The upstream route is too narrow
	│to navigate, and the downstream route is invisible due to twisting
	│walls.  There is a narrow beach to land on.
[9846]:	│Stream
[9847]:	│You are in a room which looks like an Egyptian tomb.  There is an
	│ascending staircase in the room as well as doors east and south.
[9864]:	│Egyptian Room
[9866]:	│Glacier Room
[9868]:	│You are in a small chamber behind the remains of the great glacier.
	│To the south and west are small passageways.
[9883]:	│Ruby Room
[9885]:	│You are in an ancient room, long buried by the reservoir.  There are
	│exits to the southeast and upward.
[9898]:	│Atlantis Room
[9900]:	│You are on the south edge of a deep canyon.  Passages lead off
	│to the east, south, and northwest.  You can hear the sound of
	│flowing water below.
[9919]:	│Deep Canyon
[9921]:	│You are in a large room with a ceiling which cannot be detected from
	│the ground.  There is a narrow passage from east to west and a stone
	│stairway leading upward.  The room is extremely noisy.  In fact, it
	│is difficult to hear yourself think.
[9952]:	│Loud Room
[9954]:	│Mirror Room
[9956]:	│You are in a small cave with an entrance to the north and a stairway
	│leading down.
[9967]:	│Cave
[9968]:	│You are in a tiny cave with entrances west and north, and a dark,
	│forbidding staircase leading down.
[9981]:	│You are in a steep and narrow crawlway.  There are two exits nearby to
	│the south and southwest.
[9993]:	│Steep Crawlway
[9995]:	│You are in a narrow crawlway.  The crawlway leads from north to south,
	│However, the south passage divides to the south and southwest.
[10012]:	│Narrow Crawlway
[10014]:	│You are in a cold and damp corridor where a long east-west passageway
		│intersects with a northward path.
[10027]:	│Cold Passage
[10029]:	│You are in a winding passage.  It seems that there is only an exit
		│on the east end, although the whirring from the round room can be
		│heard faintly to the north.
[10050]:	│Winding Passage
[10052]:	│You are in a small chamber, which appears to have been part of a
		│coal mine.  On the south wall of the chamber the letters "GRANITE
		│WALL" are etched in the rock.  To the east is a long passage, and
		│there is a steep metal slide twisting downward.  From the appearance
		│of the slide, an attempt to climb up it would be impossible.  To the
		│north is a small opening.
[10098]:	│Slide Room
[10100]:	│You are standing at the entrance of what might have been a coal
		│mine.  To the northeast and the northwest are entrances to the mine,
		│and there is another exit on the south end of the room.
[10124]:	│Mine Entrance
[10126]:	│You are in a small room.  Strange squeaky sounds may be hear coming
		│from the passage at the west end.  You may also escape to the south.
[10144]:	│Squeaky Room
[10146]:	│You are in a large room, in the middle of which is a small shaft
		│descending through the floor into darkness below.  To the west and
		│the north are exits from this room.  Constructed over the top of the
		│shaft is a metal framework to which a heavy iron chain is attached.
[10180]:	│Shaft Room
[10182]:	│You are in a narrow tunnel with large wooden beams running across
		│the ceiling and around the walls.  A path from the south splits into
		│paths running west and northeast.
[10204]:	│Wooden Tunnel
[10206]:	│You are in a small non-descript room.  However, from the direction
		│of a small descending staircase a foul odor can be detected.  To the
		│east is a narrow path.
[10226]:	│Smelly Room
[10228]:	│You are in a small room which smells strongly of coal gas.
[10236]:	│Gas Room
[10238]:	│You are in a very small room.  In the corner is a rickety wooden
		│ladder, leading downward.  It might be safe to descend.  There is
		│also a staircase leading upward.
[10259]:	│Ladder Top
[10261]:	│You are in a non-descript part of a coal mine.
[10267]:	│Coal Mine
[10269]:	│You are in a rather wide room.  On one side is the bottom of a
		│narrow wooden ladder.  To the northeast and the south are passages
		│leaving the room.
[10288]:	│Ladder Bottom
[10290]:	│You are in a long and narrow passage, which is cluttered with broken
		│timbers.  A wide passage comes from the north and turns at the
		│southwest corner of the room into a very narrow passageway.
[10314]:	│Timber Room
[10316]:	│You are in a small square room which is at the bottom of a long
		│shaft.  To the east is a passageway and to the northeast a very narrow
		│passage.  In the shaft can be seen a heavy iron chain.
[10340]:	│Lower Shaft
[10342]:	│Machine Room
[10344]:	│Bat Room
[10346]:	│Dome Room
[10348]:	│Torch Room
[10350]:	│You are in a north-south crawlway;  a passage also goes to the east.
		│There is a hole above, but it provides no opportunities for climbing.
[10368]:	│North-South Crawlway
[10371]:	│You are on the west edge of a chasm, the bottom of which cannot be
		│seen.  The east side is sheer rock, providing no exits.  A narrow
		│passage goes west.  The path you are on continues to the north and south.
[10397]:	│West of Chasm
[10399]:	│Round Room
[10401]:	│You are in a high north-south passage, which forks to the northeast.
[10410]:	│North-South Passage
[10413]:	│A chasm runs southwest to northeast.  You are on the south edge.  The
		│path exits to the south and to the east.
[10427]:	│Chasm
[10428]:	│You are in a cave.  Passages exit to the south and to the east, but
		│the cave narrows to a crack to the west.  The earth is particularly
		│damp here.
[10447]:	│Damp Cave
[10449]:	│A chasm, evidently produced by an ancient river, runs through the
		│cave here.  Passages lead off in all directions.
[10464]:	│Ancient Chasm
[10466]:	│You have entered a cave with passages leading north and southeast.
[10475]:	│Engravings Cave
[10477]:	│This is a room which is bare on all sides.  There is an exit down.
		│To the east is a great door made of stone.  Above the door, the
		│following words are written:  "No man shall enter this room without
		│solving this riddle--
		│	What is tall as a house,
		│	Round as a cup,
		│	And all the king's horses can't draw it up?".
[10516]:	│Riddle Room
[10518]:	│This is a former broom closet.  The exits are to the east and west.
[10527]:	│Pearl Room
[10529]:	│Entrance to Hades
[10532]:	│Land of the Living Dead
[10535]:	│You are standing in a small circular room with a pedestal.  A set of
		│stairs leads up, and passages leave the the east and west.
[10551]:	│Grail Room
[10553]:	│You are in the west end of a large temple.  On the south wall is an
		│ancient inscription, probably a prayer in a long-forgotten language.
		│The north wall is solid granite.  The entrance at the west end of the
		│room is through huge marble pillars.
[10584]:	│Temple
[10585]:	│You are in the east end of a large temple.  In front of you is what
		│appears to be an altar.
[10597]:	│Altar
[10598]:	│Dam
[10599]:	│This room appears to have been the waiting room for groups touring
		│the dam.  There are exits here to the north and east marked
		│"PRIVATE", though the doors are open, and an exit to the south.
[10623]:	│Dam Lobby
[10625]:	│You are in what appears to have been the maintenance room for flood
		│control dam #3, judging by the assortment of tool chests around the
		│room.  Apparently, this room has been ransacked recently, for most of
		│the valuable equipment is gone.  On the wall in front of you is a
		│panel of buttons, which are labelled in EBCDIC.  However, they are of
		│different colors:  blue, yellow, brown, and red.  The doors to this
		│room are in the west and south ends.
[10681]:	│Maintenance Room
[10684]:	│Cyclops Room
[10686]:	│You are in a long passage.  To the south is one entrance.  On the
		│east there is an old wooden door with a large hole in it (about
		│cyclops sized).
[10705]:	│Strange Passage
[10707]:	│This is a large room, whose north wall is solid granite.  A number
		│of discarded bags, which crumble at your touch, are scattered about
		│on the floor.  There is an exit down and what appears to be a newly
		│created passage to the east.
[10736]:	│Treasure Room
[10738]:	│You are in what appears to have been an artist's studio.  The walls
		│and floors are splattered with paints of 69 different colors.
		│Strangely enough, nothing of value is hanging here.  At the north and
		│northwest of the room are open doors (also covered with paint).  An
		│extremely dark and narrow chimney leads up from a fireplace.  Although
		│you might be able to get up the chimney, it seems unlikely that you
		│could get back down.
[10792]:	│Studio
[10793]:	│You are in an art gallery.  Most of the paintings which were here
		│have been stolen by vandals with exceptional taste.  The vandals
		│left through the north, south, or west exits.
[10816]:	│Gallery
[10817]:	│You are at the base of flood control dam #3, which looms above you
		│and to the north.   The Frigid River is flowing by here.  Across the
		│river are the white cliffs, which seem to form a giant wall stretching
		│from north to south along the east shore of the river as it winds its
		│way downstream.
[10854]:	│Dam Base
[10856]:	│You are on the Frigid River in the vicinity of the dam.  The river
		│flows quietly here.  There is a landing on the west shore.
[10872]:	│Frigid River
[10874]:	│The river turns a corner here making it impossible to see the
		│dam.  The white cliffs loom on the east bank, and large rocks
		│prevent landing on the west.
[10894]:	│The river descends here into a valley.  There is a narrow beach on
		│the east below the cliffs, and there is some shore on the west which
		│may be suitable.  In the distance a faint rumbling can be heard.
[10920]:	│You are on a narrow strip of beach which runs along the base of the
		│white cliffs.  The only path here is a narrow one, heading south
		│along the cliffs.
[10939]:	│White Cliffs Beach
[10942]:	│You are on a rocky, narrow strip of beach beside the cliffs.  A
		│narrow path leads north along the shore.
[10956]:	│The river is running faster here, and the sound ahead appears to be
		│that of rushing water.  On the west shore is a sandy beach.  A small
		│area of beach can also be seen below the cliffs.
[10980]:	│The sound of rushing water is nearly unbearable here.  On the west
		│shore is a large landing area.
[10993]:	│Moby Lossage
[10995]:	│You are on the shore of the river.  The river here seems somewhat
		│treacherous.  A path travels from north to south here, the south end
		│quickly turning around a sharp corner.
[11017]:	│Shore
[11018]:	│You are on a large sandy beach at the shore of the river, which is
		│flowing quickly by.  A path runs beside the river to the south here.
[11035]:	│Sandy Beach
[11037]:	│You are on the west shore of the river.  An entrance to a cave is
		│to the northwest.  The shore is very rocky here.
[11052]:	│Rocky Shore
[11054]:	│You are in a small cave whose exits are on the south and northwest.
[11063]:	│Small Cave
[11065]:	│You are in a barrel.  Congratulations.  Etched into the side of the
		│barrel is the word "GERONIMO!".
[11078]:	│Barrel
[11079]:	│Aragain Falls
[11081]:	│You are on top of a rainbow (I bet you never thought you would walk
		│on a rainbow), with a magnificent view of the falls.  The rainbow
		│travels east-west here.
[11101]:	│Rainbow room
[11103]:	│You are on a small beach on the continuation of the Frigid River
		│past the falls.  The beach is narrow due to the presence of the white
		│cliffs.  The river canyon opens here, and sunlight shines in from
		│above.  A rainbow crosses over the falls to the west, and a narrow path
		│continues to the southeast.
[11141]:	│End of rainbow
[11143]:	│You are beneath the walls of the river canyon, which may be climbable
		│here.  There is a small stream here, which is the lesser part of the
		│runoff of Aragain Falls.  To the north is a narrow path.
[11168]:	│Canyon Bottom
[11170]:	│You are on a ledge about halfway up the wall of the river canyon.
		│You can see from here that the main flow from Aragain Falls twists
		│along a passage which it is impossible to enter.  Below you is the
		│canyon bottom.  Above you is more cliff, which still appears
		│climbable.
[11204]:	│Rocky Ledge
[11206]:	│You are at the top of the great canyon on its south wall. From here
		│there is a marvelous view of the canyon and parts of the Frigid River
		│upstream.  Across the canyon, the walls of the white cliffs still
		│appear to loom far above.  Following the canyon upstream (north and
		│northwest), Aragain Falls may be seen, complete with rainbow.
		│Fortunately, my vision is better than average, and I can discern the
		│top of flood control dam #3 far to the distant north.  To the
		│west and south can be seen an immense forest, stretching for miles
		│around.  It is possible to climb down into the canyon from here.
[11281]:	│Canyon View
[11283]:	│You are at the bottom of a large dormant volcano.  High above you
		│light may be seen entering from the cone of the volcano.  The only
		│exit here is to the north.
[11303]:	│Volcano Bottom
[11305]:	│You are about one hundred feet above the bottom of the volcano.  The
		│top of the volcano is clearly visible here.
[11320]:	│Volcano Core
[11322]:	│You are about two hundred feet above the volcano floor.  Looming
		│above is the rim of the volcano.  There is a small ledge on the
		│west side.
[11340]:	│Volcano near small ledge
[11344]:	│You are high above the floor of the volcano.  From here the rim of
		│the volcano looks very narrow, and you are quite near it.  To the
		│east is what appears to be a viewing ledge, too thin to land on.
[11369]:	│Volcano near viewing ledge
[11373]:	│You are near the rim of the volcano, which is only about fifteen feet
		│across.  To the west, there is a place to land with a wide ledge.
[11390]:	│Volcano near wide ledge
[11393]:	│You are on a narrow ledge overlooking the inside of an old dormant
		│volcano.  This ledge appears to be about in the middle between the
		│floor below and the rim above.  There is an exit here to the south.
[11419]:	│Narrow Ledge
[11421]:	│You are on a ledge in the middle of a large volcano.  Below you
		│the volcano bottom can be seen and above is the rim of the volcano.
		│A couple of ledges can be seen on the other side of the volcano;
		│it appears that this ledge is intermediate in elevation between
		│those on the other side.  The exit from this room is to the east.
[11462]:	│Volcano View
[11464]:	│Wide ledge
[11466]:	│You are in a room which must have been a large library, probably
		│for the royal family.  All of the shelves appear to have been gnawed
		│to pieces by unfriendly gnomes.  To the north is an exit.
[11490]:	│Library
[11491]:	│Dusty Room
[11493]:	│You are in a small room, whose walls are formed by an old lava flow.
		│There are exits here to the west and the south.
[11508]:	│Lava Room
[11510]:	│Tomb of the Unknown Implementer
[11514]:	│Low Room
[11516]:	│You are in a large room full of assorted heavy machinery.  The room
		│smells of burned resistors.  The room is noisy from the whirring
		│sounds of the machines.  Along one wall of the room are three buttons
		│which are, respectively, round, triangular, and square.  Naturally,
		│above the buttons are instructions written in EBCDIC.  A large sign
		│above all the buttons says in English:
		│
		│		    DANGER:  HIGH VOLTAGE
		│
		│There are exits to the west and the south.
[11573]:	│You are in a dingy closet adjacent to the machine room.  On one wall
		│is a small sticker which reads:
		│
		│		Protected by
		│		  FROBOZZ
		│	     Magic Alarm Company
		│	      (Hello, footpad!).
[11596]:	│Dingy Closet
[11598]:	│You are trapped inside an steel cage.
[11603]:	│Cage
[11604]:	│You are at the top of the well.  Well done.  There are etchings on
		│the side of the well.  There is a small crack across the floor at the
		│entrance to a room on the east, but it can be crossed easily.
[11629]:	│Top of Well
[11631]:	│You are in a damp circular room, whose walls are made of brick and
		│mortar.  The roof of this room is not visible, but there appear to be
		│some etchings on the walls.  There is a passageway to the west.
[11657]:	│Bottom of Well
[11659]:	│You are in a small square room, in the center of which is a large
		│oblong table, no doubt set for afternoon tea.  It is clear from the
		│objects on the table that the users were indeed mad.  In the eastern
		│corner of this room is a small hole no more than four inches high.
		│There are passageways leading away to the west and the northwest.
[11701]:	│Tea Room
[11703]:	│You are in an enormous room, in the center of which are four wooden
		│posts delineating a rectangular area, above which is what appears to
		│be a wooden roof.  In fact, all objects in this room appear to be
		│abnormally large.  To the east is a passageway.  There is a large
		│chasm on the west and the northwest.
[11742]:	│Posts Room
[11744]:	│You are in a large room, one half of which is depressed.  There is a
		│large leak in the ceiling through which brown colored goop is
		│falling.  The only exit from this room is to the west.
[11768]:	│Pool Room
[11770]:	│Up a Tree
[11772]:	│You are in the large entrance hall of the Bank of Zork, the largest
		│banking institution of the Great Underground Empire.  A partial
		│account of its history is in "The Lives of the Twelve Flatheads" with
		│the chapter on J. Pierpont Flathead.  A more detailed history (albeit
		│less objective) may be found in Flathead's outrageous autobiography
		│"I'm Rich and You Aren't - So There!".
		│Most of the furniture has been ravaged by passing scavengers.  All
		│that remains are two signs at the northwest and northeast corners of
		│the room, which say
		│
		│	<-- WEST VIEWING ROOM		EAST VIEWING ROOM -->
[11845]:	│Bank Entrance
[11847]:	│You are in a small square room, which was used by a bank officer
		│whose job it was to retrieve safety deposit boxes for the customer.
		│On the north side of the room is a sign which reads "Viewing Room".
		│On the west side of the room, above an open door, is a sign reading

		│
		│   REMAIN HERE WHILE THE BANK OFFICER RETRIEVES YOUR DEPOSIT BOX
		│    WHEN YOU ARE FINISHED, LEAVE THE BOX, AND EXIT TO THE SOUTH
		│     AN ADVANCED PROTECTIVE DEVICE PREVENTS ALL CUSTOMERS FROM

		│               Thank you for banking at the Zork!
[11982]:	│Viewing Room
[11984]:	│You are in a small bare room with no distinguishing features.  There
		│are no exits from this room.
[11997]:	│Small Room
[11999]:	│You are in the Vault of the Bank of Zork, in which there are no doors.
[12008]:	│Vault
[12009]:	│You are in a large rectangular room.  The east and west walls here
		│were used for storing safety deposit boxes.  As might be expected,
		│all have been carefully removed by evil persons.  To the east, west,
		│and south of the room are large doorways.  The northern "wall"
		│of the room is a shimmering curtain of light.  In the center of the
		│room is a large stone cube, about 10 feet on a side.  Engraved on
		│the side of the cube is some lettering.
[12064]:	│Safety Depository
[12067]:	│This room was the office of the Chairman of the Bank of Zork.
		│Like the other rooms here, it has been extensively vandalized.

		│
		│  Flood control dam #3 (FCD #3) was constructed in year 783 of the
		│Great Underground Empire to harness the destructive power of the
		│Frigid River.  This work was supported by a grant of 37 million
		│zorkmids from the central bureaucracy and your own omnipotent local
		│tyrant Lord Dimwit Flathead the Excessive.  This impressive structure
		│is composed of 3.7 cubic feet of concrete, is 256 feet tall at the
		│center, and 193 feet wide at the top.  The reservoir created behind
		│the dam has a volume of 37 billion cubic feet, an area of 12 million
		│square feet, and a shore line of 36 thousand feet.
		│
		│  The construction of FCD #3 took 112 days from ground breaking to
		│the dedication.  It required a work force of 384 slaves, 34 slave
		│drivers, 12 engineers, 2 turtle doves, and a partridge in a pear
		│tree.  The work was managed by a command team composed of 234
		│bureaucrats, 2347 secretaries (at least two of whom could type),
		│12,256 paper shufflers, 52,469 rubber stampers, 245,193 red tape
		│processors, and nearly one million dead trees.
		│
		│  We will now point out some of the more interesting features of
		│FCD #3 as we conduct you on a guided tour of the facilities.

		│The endgame is here!  (Somewhere)
		│There have been some puzzling new discoveries near the Thief's hideaway.
		│
		│		--- BACKGROUND INFORMATION ---
		│
		│This version of Dungeon for the PDP-11/VAX-11 has been completely
		│reimplemented in FORTRAN-IV from the original MDL sources created
		│at MIT.  The parser in this version is somewhat simpler than the
		│parser in the ARPAnet version;  within this limit, this version
		│is fully congruent with the current version on the ARPAnet.
		│
		│This version has been converted from FORTRAN-IV to C via f77.  If
		│you have any problems, please report them to:

		│
		│Mr. TAA of Muddle, Mass. says:  "Before I took this course I used
		│to be a lowly bit twiddler.  Now with what I learned at MIT Tech
		│I feel really important and can obfuscate and confuse with the best."
		│
		│Mr. MARC had this to say:  "Ten short days ago all I could look
		│forward to was a dead-end job as a engineer.  Now I have a promising
		│future and make really big Zorkmids."
		│
		│MIT Tech can't promise these fantastic results to everyone, but when
		│you earn your MDL degree from MIT Tech your future will be brighter.

		│
		│   Dungeon is a game of adventure, danger, and low cunning.  In it
		│you will explore some of the most amazing territory ever seen by mortal
		│man.  Hardened adventurers have run screaming from the terrors contained
		│within.
		│
		│   In Dungeon, the intrepid explorer delves into the forgotten secrets
		│of a lost labyrinth deep in the bowels of the earth, searching for
		│vast treasures long hidden from prying eyes, treasures guarded by
		│fearsome monsters and diabolical traps!
		│
		│   No DECsystem should be without one!
		│
		│   Dungeon was created at the Programming Technology Division of the MIT
		│Laboratory for Computer Science by Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce
		│Daniels, and Dave Lebling.  It was inspired by the Adventure game of
		│Crowther and Woods, and the Dungeons and Dragons game of Gygax
		│and Arneson.  The original version was written in MDL (alias MUDDLE).
		│The current version was translated from MDL into FORTRAN IV by
		│a somewhat paranoid DEC engineer who prefers to remain anonymous,
		│and was later translated to C.

		│   On-line information may be obtained with the commands HELP and INFO.
